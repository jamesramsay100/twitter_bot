        "* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n",
        "*  **`include_prefix`**: If using `truncate` and `include_prefix=False`, the specified `prefix` will not be included in the returned text."
