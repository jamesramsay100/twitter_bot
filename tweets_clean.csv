Also I m not saying I m giving up on winning the Premier League but losing today has severely hampered our chances
If you ask any manager in the country they ll say that Turf Moor is by far one of the hardest away ground to go to So to only lose 2 1 to Burnley is actually a great result
The important thing is not to stop questioning Curiosity has its own reason for existence One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity of life of the marvelous structure of reality

Delighted to sign a new Leicester City contract after only 9 months at the club Jamie Vardy James Maddison and Youri Tielemans are arguably the best players I ve ever managed I d go as far as saying they are better than Luis Suarez Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho
I can clarify that I am having contract talks with Leicester City today amid the interest from Arsenal I have a few demands I m hoping they ll meet Joe Allen a new car and a lifetime supply of Walkers crisps being just a few of them

Definitely having a wank with a pipe of Pringles tonight Might not even empty it out first
I woke up this morning and stared at my erection It was truly magnificent As pulsating as an Aphex Twin deep cut and as thick as a Kardashian s hoop I knew immediately that today was going to be a good day
Had to take a job at Argos to tide me over during the holiday season It s not even behind the tills I m one of those cunts fetching stuff from the stockroom My fucking headset doesn t even work Please buy my bastard book for someone this Christmas
Manchester United The time has come Whisper my name amongst the winds of change and I shall appear Purse your hungry desolate lips and suckle greedily upon my mighty weeping teat I do insist on keeping my own image rights mind That s non negotiable
I would like to announce I have decided to leave Everton Putting a fucking Angry Bird on the shirt was the last straw Fucking tinpot
I carry a prosthetic leg with me at all times For mystery purposes I don t tell the lads why I have it let them marinate in their own curiosity I just beat Wayne Rooney about the face and neck with it then put him in a tumble dryer Nobody swears at the Raj of Merseyside
He was Professor Hawking to the world of science but just little Ste to me I wrote about taking him to a discotheque for the first time in my book Twirling him around the dance floor like a delirious bin bag full of joy Goodnight sweet prince
Really can t be arsed with Everton tbh
That s super champ I said before ruffling his hair lifting him gently into my arms and putting him back into the ball pen outside my office He s earned it today His hair really is fucking appalling though
After I d finished reading Wazza put up his hand said Hi daddy my fave book is called The Detective Dog and it s about this dog that smells really good and he can smell anything and he goes to school and when all the school books go missing he uses his nose to find them
As a reward for yesterday s sensational performance I gave the lads some hot milk cookies let them lie down on the floor of my office and read them a chapter from my sensational new book which is available from Amazon at the low low price of 10 48
And as the grey sky rumbles on high and the liver bird roars below a figure emerges on the horizon He rides a steed of tactical aplomb and carries a shield of sheer bravado For he is Big Sam and he has Merseyside by the feisty little minge
I stand naked at the mouth of the river Mersey As the wicked winter winds whip my naked form my taut tadger waves to and fro conducting the river in some sort of primal orchestral manoeuvre A pigeon perches upon my mighty cock I smile Yeah I think I m ready for the Derby
They can get rid of that Z Cars muck for a start If I m walking out to music it ll be something fucking dope Something fucking REAL Bring Da Ruckus by Wu Tang Clan perhaps Or anything by Eagle Eye Cherry
Every murderous cloud has a silver lining folks Every fucking one of them
Richard Madeley though says my book is the funniest thing since Judy tried to get into the bath after 27 vodkas
The destruction wrought by Hurricane Irma is a sobering reminder of the truly wicked power of Mother Nature
Micheal Ball says he s VERY interested in playing Fritzl Fingers crossed In the meantime this is out tomorrow
A dog A cat What the fuck is that A pie A hat What the fuck is that A Ford Mondeo and a Vampire bat What The fuck IS THAAAATTTT
It s called What The Fuck is That and it s an absolute shot stopper of a cunt
It builds up to the final song which tackles the sensory overload experienced by the girls as they see the outside world for the 1st time
I m in such a rich vein of literary form at the moment Just finished writing my next project a musical based on the Josef Fritzl case
Nice review of my book from Simon Weston The whole thing crackles throughout he said Like my head Great guy
Do buy it though It s hard to make ends meet in retirement and Colin from The Money Shop is an unfeeling callous cunt
On 07 09 17 feast Feast on the very parchments of my wisdom Let the scratchings of my quill expand your mind
He followed this up licking a battery and saying haha it s all tingly innit but his point still stood
You ve done everything in football gaffer he continued It s time to conquer the literary world
Big Carlton Cole once said to me Great literature boss is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree
Some books have the power to change the world The power to educate The power to challenge
The first Adrian Mole
On The Origin of Species
Arsene Wenger will be yanking bits of my fingernails out of his fluffy French minge for weeks after that Fucking devastating
What a game It had absolutely everything I was squealing like a Japanese tourist Nobody gave them a chance but well played Stoke
Bested by Moysie Cunting Moysie It s like Professor Stephen Hawking making you tap out with a figure four leglock FML
Emerging The light The scream The air The thunder The life Glistening Breathing Wanting It s 2016 and Christ has been born again
Wearing nowt but a cape holding my plonker like a mic singing I Know It s Over by the Smiths into it I think this has all just hit me
It s Sammy Lee I feel sorry for He s just got Sky Q in for fuck sake
It s not me They can do anything with digital effects these days Look at that cunt Jar Jar Binks
Piece of fucking piss Like taking candy from Stephen Hawking that was The prick
Kurt Cobain was my friend And he knew I d be England manager one day
Tomorrow yields my coronation And ye shall follow me to the kingdom of glory And I m going to get so much bouncy fucking fanny on the way
I am a king For this I was born and for this I came into the world to testify to the truth I am the Messiah the Son of the living God
Christ David Gill s shitter can take a pounding I laid an egg like a chocolate caterpillar cake it sucked it down in one go Fair play
I promised myself I d secure Premier League safety before I took my fight to ISIS Now you shit haired cunts prepare to feel the blaze
Football on the telly a can of Dale s Pale Ale in my hand and eating orange Matchmakers out of the wife s arse Pressure What pressure
Big Sam teases the very anus of Dutch fear before plunging in the long cunning fingers of tactical bombardment
Any good contract lawyers in the Sunderland area ASAP lads yeah
Love watching this Man United side Thrilled by their new approach It s like watching myself make love which has always been a dream
The shrooms are starting to wear off Why the fuck am I in Sunderland
Slags of Merseyside and Wearside State your case and state it wisely For I am Big Sam and soon I may feast on your filth
Identity theft is a serious crime pal Prepare to feel my wrath
I m wearing Uggs on Sky right now Jamie is wearing Hi Tecs and Niall is in Primark brogues Big Sam out of the game No fucking chance
Once made love to Cilla on an empty Palladium stage That s a lorra lorra cock she squealed as Tarby watched on from the rafters RIP
Sexually Judy Murray is at her very best when she s in a bad mood Lucky is the man that feasts on her truculent flesh tonight
Anyway got a Skype job interview with Allied Dunbar tomorrow Need to find that fucking charger Haven t used the laptop since Y2K
The more I think of him the more I fucking hate Sepp Blatter I wish the rotten little Orc was dead
Then when Qatar got the World Cup Blatter told me he fingered a dusty Arabian whore with a boxing glove whilst laughing his head off
He also has a bumbag with It s not illegal if it s with your Sepp Daddy on it He s giddy for creepy name puns the little fucking goblin
Then again he had a notepad full of appalling jokes he d written with Blatter Patter on the cover in big letters A cunt truth be told
Not his biggest fan but I ve seen Sepp scream BLATTER right at the point of ejaculation at orgies His sense of occasion is sensational
If that doesn t showcase my sensational ability to work miracles with threadbare resources to potential employers nothing will
Just had one of my patented flaccid wanks over the People You May Know section on LinkedIn
Goodbye my lovers Goodbye my friends You have been the ones You have been the ones for me
Just Skyped Nigel Pearson dressed up like Rod Hull Emu Emu wasn t an ostrich though was he He was an emu Feel like a right cunt now
Kyle Walker thinks he s a sexual innovator does he Wait until he lets a Doberman eat a Chewit out of his asshole Then he get step to me
I may have to let my West Ham boys go in order to set them free A freak show peddler taught me that
I had a wank earlier With a Pringles tube And it wasn t even empty Why Because I have the freedom to do what I want Thank you Lord
And it s Jesus courage that gives me strength and the belief that I can improve on six points from a possible 24 I ll do it for him
Jesus just took it in his stride even when he died in a field like some sort of majestic scarecrow And he died for us And for freedom
And Jesus was all whatever and he remained as serene as fuck took whatever they threw at him Even when they put nettles on his head
He took it and was all that all you got and the Romans were all nah pal I ve also got a big fucking whip with spikes attached to it
At this time all those years ago Christ was getting a right good walloping I mean a serious hammering Getting it from all bloody angles
As a chariot of slags shames country at Twickenham one dragon swoops o er the ruins breathing fire restoring pride Big Sam be his name
Shouted are you a dick advocate Dick Advocaat whilst flopping my big sturdy todger towards him Not a flicker on his face Game on
Well every one of these useless bastards can now watch me wank in the hot tub Whilst maintaining eye contact They must learn from this
Out of the cup on Valentine s Day My patented annual beanbag wankfest will be draped in a thoroughly unexpected melancholy Useless cunts
Just ate a Ferrero Rocher out of the arse of London s finest discount whore I m so fucking sophisticated it hurts For real
My fangs drip red with the blood of Dutch quim Today I am content but I ll feast again Oh I ll feast again Sleep well Louis van Gaal
The biggest Blind cunt since Blunkett Bastard
Took a sack of whizz and missed the entire Royal Rumble FML
As she hit the ground with a thwack she looked back at me mouthed the words that s why you re the best What a trooper So fond of her
Just launched the wife over the banister as she was racing up the stairs for a shit Yep I ve got Royal Rumble fever and I fucking love it
Saturday 30 May 2015 The day you see my sumptuous genitals poured gloriously into the FA Cup Believe
Can I have Monster Munch tonight boss Cos of the good goal I done Can I Course you can Andy Have a Chomp too you loveable cunt
Love quality time with the Professor I m going to roll him down a grassy dew drenched bank later Big Sam is grabbing 2015 by the minge
Bet You Wouldn t Super Glue Your Lad To Your Belly And Piss Into Your Own Face That ll be 5 please Professor Hawking
Just ordered a sausage supper in chip shop with my cock hanging out Nobody even noticed We just don t interact as a society anymore Sad
Feast Feast on my milky teat of triumph For I am Big Sam and I am a footballing god
Probably spark up a few doobies in a bit Stick on some Four Tet Might shove a toothbrush up my arse as well I ve taken hold of the night
A few bottles of Erdinger Dunkel Weissbier Far Cry 4 and the finest ketamine Dave Benson Phillips can provide 99 Problems Not me pal
I m more dynamic than this Liverpool team and I haven t moved since punk When Stephen Hawking zings in a text that cunt zings hard
Big fucking Sam He s still got it
Just sang Sun Kil Moon s Benji in its entirety to the wife Upon the last chord she tearily bared her muff and said take it maestro
Manager of the Month Manager of the year I d say Manager of the century Manager of your hearts
Skype call with Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich What a thrilling belated Halloween treat Those two cats still give me the bloody willies
It s a good thing my plonker is so fucking massive because I ve been plunging it into a lot of Premier League arse this season Have it
Cocaine out of a dwarf s arse Turning 60 is off the cunting hook
Having a luxury wank in the shower along to Unbreak My Heart by Toni Braxton I m 60 on Sunday but the fire inside me still rages
An evening of craft beer tasting with Sophie B Hawkins Doesn t get much better than this lads Doesn t get much better than this
I respect Louis van Gaal It won t stop me from destroying him though
United on Saturday Should be training these cunts but this new Ahex Twin joint has me fucking entranced Throwing shapes all over the shop
I m doing an E tonight Fuck it I m doing an E Fucking buzzing
He ll not get to see Falkor the charismatic Luckdragon now That s the real tragedy here That flying cunt was simply magical
Then he tore a radiator off the wall and fired it at Mark Noble Fuck this Back to the cones and the fucking drills Great film mind
Where horse go boss he yelped tears streaming down his delicate face Where horse go Horse go heaven BRING BACK HORSE
Watching The NeverEnding Story with the lads Fucking huge mistake Big Carlton went berserk when that fucking horse died in the swamp
It s in their eyes The Man City lads In their eyes All the eyes What could Big Sam do with this squad in Europe They fucking know it
Win lose or draw Steve Bruce always pops over for a post game chat with a full roast chicken a sack full of gravy He s different class
The sun is shining and there s modestly sized perky tits everywhere Honestly I ve got so much bloody time for modestly sized perky tits
Guess that s the real tragedy of this story He didn t use his magnet legs for good He didn t harness their power for justice The prick
Did you know that Pistorius s metal legs are actually magnets If you took a fridge to one of his races he d hurtle towards it instantly
Karren Brady keeps sending me video of fella waving dildo at Sky reporter I ve ground that model to a dusty nub she claims Terrifying
Big Carlton Stewie have earned their bowls of custard today Big bowls too We ve got all the custard they roared with glee Lovely
Disappointed by today s result but fucking hell I looked smart on Match of the Day Like a young Kevin s dad from The Wonder Years
What will the final Premier League table of the season look like Big Sam Like this you inquisitive slags
As an aside I m absolutely thrilled that Phil Neville has got the Match Of The Day job An absolute darling that lad
Fuck Netanyahu I roar with one final leg press I stand erect Sorry queers I didn t bring a hand towel I exit to wild cheers
Sweat trickles down my glistening undercarriage and onto the leather seat A puddle of rippling masculinity One woman queefs in excitement
Naked workout at the gym Everyone crowded around me at the leg press gawping at the most defined cock balls perineum they ll ever see
Social media It s not all pictures of your dinner and asking celebs to have sex with you It s a bloody landmine

I m wearing a top hat and between each stroke I m doffing it like a splendid Victorian gentleman Christ I m in a wacky mood today
Having a wank to Cloudbusting by Kate Bush The gorgeously intense strings lend an almost military precision to the proceedings Superb
The unresolved tension between the two of them is monstrous I think it may also be bristling with latent racism Funny as fuck though
I couldn t breathe with laughter If it wasn t full of my own semen I d have grabbed my vintage WWF foam finger and waved it with delight
Ted doesn t give a fuck His theme music is on now and he s prancing around the room swinging his staggering cock about like a helicopter
Virgil is going fucking mental at this stage screaming about affirmative action and pulling out a steel chair from underneath his sofa
By now Virgil is attacking his own laptop he s so angry So Ted stands up he s wearing nowt downstairs apart from his Million Dollar Belt
Virgil goes What do you know about soccer you bearded old minge Ted laughs even harder and throws a 20 dollar bill at the screen
Virgil fancies Italy tonight Ted thew his head back laughed his balls off at this Virgil was fucking seething Christ I was in stiches

Enough about that though I promised big Mohammed Diame I d take him to see Friends With Kids tonight so I may as well get it over with
And the smell Good God the fucking smell
I ll be caressing my cock later in the day without a care in the world and then a putrid ball of yellow terror will pop out of the folds
One drawback with long foreskin of course is the hideous pieces of bog roll left behind after I delictately dab my helmet after a piss
I don t care if it s arrogant I bloody love my genitalia I can stare at it for hours and still discover something new exciting about it
Fully extended it looks like one of Dhalsim s big bendy arms It has so much bloody character
Just looking at my tadger My foreskin really is incredibly long And stretchy I can pull it out a good three or four inches
Gutted by the result but what a performance from Pirlo He looks like a flamboyant yet intense concert pianist driven by a tragic past
Is Jonathan Pearce s wife in Warsaw tonight If so she s getting Ronaldo 7 scribbled on her back and her arsehole is getting destroyed
Which leads me to believe lady mutts must have a cheeky clitoris tucked away somewhere Lovely cross from Gerrard for the goal tonight
As the hound was dragging its filthy ringpiece across the grass its eyes rolled skywards in what can only be described as orgasmic fervour
As I was out roller skating in the park yesterday I came across a dog taking a shit Upon further inspection I noticed it had a minge
Great result in the game tonight Proud to be an Englishman Do girl dog s have clits Been wondering about that all day
I stood by the phone for a full 13 minutes in the dark just imagining things It was 1994 He had those blonde highlights I m only human
I ll sling my tadger up your missus champ while buggering you senseless with my big old conk he said I put the phone down immediately
True story Andy Townsend once asked me and the wife to have a threesome with him A daisy chain fuckfest he promised
And what the fuck is Townsend wearing Is he off pheasant shooting afterwards The big nosed dork
I d then stride awesomely around the pitch zapping dickheads in the crowd with my mystical blade I d start with those cunts in face paint
Strike me I d roar Strike me oh gods of thunder so that I may harness and use your electrical power for my own extraordinary ends
If I was there I d be standing slap bang in the centre circle with my magnificent Viking sword Trudy pointed high to the heavens
Shameful scenes in Donetsk To mince off the pitch due to a bit of drizzle and some lightning is frankly disgusting Big poofs
Tried to make some notes about potential transfer targets during this game but all I ve done is scrawl Lawro is a cunt 246 times Cunt
I feel fucking sick Thank Christ the wife was inhaling solvents in the bathroom If she had caught me I d be on the fucking news right now
I looked on it horror as my shaft exploded like a bottle of disturbed Yop while the doll s innocent smiling face looked coldly back at me
So what did these fucks do Stuck in a picture of a child s doll at 6 mins 59 seconds Cunts I couldn t stop I just I couldn t stop
But the cunts have fucking done me Everyone at West Ham knows I usually blow my bugle at around the seven minute mark during a wank
It was a thing of fucking beauty full of slow motion transitions and soundtracked by Explosions in the Sky My cock was out within seconds
Got my sports science team to put together a video reel full of clips of all those gorgeous European girls captured on camera at Euro 2012
And now we go from Clarence s sweet soulful tones back to Mark Bright sounding like an anxious confused cretin trapped in a lift
Don t want to be crude but imagine being fingered by Clarence Seedorf His soft experienced fingers Inside you Fuck I m getting chills
Look at little Clarence Seedorf in the BBC studio there What a dreamboat I bet he smells fucking amazing A class act
Sammy don t hurt me don t hurt me no more he sang as I swooped in for Schweinsteiger and Llorente What a fucking character he is
A pint of mild with Haddaway as we make our final selections for our Euro 2012 fantasy football teams I m having a fucking blast
I d pay good money to see Elton sing Candle In The Wind whilst yelling WHAT DID YOU DO towards the Queen He won t though The tit
Elton sounds like someone s chopped his nose off And he looks like Judge Judy
Fuck me sideways That Gary Barlow song is a monstrosity It sounded like the souls of a slain village all rising up and crying at once
Prince Philip may be laying in a hospital bed with a bellend that feels like a raging volcano but he s had a lucky escape here Christ
If that cunt Brian May starts playing his fucking wooden guitar on a roof I m storming the event with a bow and arrow
Dear God this Jubilee concert is worse than fucking polio
We are a simple nautical disaster away from being ruled by John Barrowman for fuck sake
Watching this Jubilee flotilla thing What prick decided to put all our precious Royals in the same boat Haven t they seen King Ralph
But most of all I ll just miss you And the government payments the club recieved for employing you God speed Robert Always in my heart
I ll miss long and cosy afternoons spent teaching you how to read using Birds Eye Alphabites
I ll miss your cute little baseball cap with the plastic propellors on top of it I ll miss your devastating fear or fire electricty
I ll miss the way you dribble in between sentences I ll miss the adorable sight of your soggy mittens lying on the shower room floor
Farewell Rob Green You were like an affectionate remedial son to me I ll miss your confused jam stained face
Yeah Well it s a good job Sir Alex lets me use his account details to watch Sky Go on my Xbox 360 then isn t it Boom
Virgin doesn t even have Sky Atlantic Big Sam I can hear you croak smugly That s like the best channel ever you fucking spunk bag
The leap from Championship manager to a Premier League one really hits home when you can watch Comedy Central in HD I feel fucking awesome
Just upgraded from the Virgin M TV package to the L and added an extra TiVo box for the back room
I ve got a big donation for this Caroline Flack poppet after I ve won this fucking game Right in her lovely little piggy bank
Another afternoon of pretending to care about some kid in Africa with no leg whilst trying to work out who Jonathan Wilkes is B O R I N G
And now I ve got to peel myself away from the shimmering blaze of this glorious sun and go back to my Soccer Aid duties Fuck sake
It won t affect everyone but it will affect enough to make it a real problem I guess what I m saying is just be aware And stay safe
When you add this to the inevitable sweaty climate the heat will bring to this area then I don t need to tell you I could be in trouble
I didn t really wipe my arsehole properly earlier and I can already feel a sloppy stinging repercussion around the greater anal area
The soaring heat of the sun carries many dangers though and I really can t emphasise this enough
The white marks on my upper thighs are adorable Sir Alex said my lower half was like a pint of Guinness when he saw me naked Hilarious
The sun is shining the Premier League is looming my bleached denim shorts are hugging me like a guilty father Life is good for Big Sam
Big Sam pushes apart the thick thighs of panic peels back the labia minora of anxiety and feasts on the very clitoris of triumph
Because I love cunnilingus and it slows me down It really is that simple It s just sexual science
I know what all you TV viewers are thinking right now Hey Big Sam Why don t you grow back your glorious and still stylish moustache
I then sat down gently and lead the boys in a rousing rendition of Crossroads by Bone Thugs N Harmony We re winning this cunt today
He soon forgot all about my lop sided bollocks when I quite literally pissed in his dismal fucking face
Rob Green then ruined the whole aura of the moment by pointing out that my testes are very heavily weighted to the east side of my ballbag
This can be all yours I roared imperiously This can be your destiny You quite simply put can become gods today Join me
Look at me boys I whispered mysteriously Look at the granite like definition Look at the tan Look at my big fucking plonker
Instead I simply stood in front of them Naked Naked and silent but for the gentle swoosh of my cock swinging hypnotically in the breeze
I ve spent hours this morning trying to think of how best to inspire my boys Tactical acumen Poetry Sheer unadulterated rage Sweets No
How can I focus fully on my plans to destroy these seaside tramps when Keegan Michael Key is hitting the comedy ball right out of the park
Incredible episode of Planet s Funniest Animals Christ I m in stitches The dozy dog The weasels That cunt of a cat falling down Ace
Imagine the scenes Hollaway looking like a cunt on the touchline in his tractor while Big Sam pistol whips the linesman with a gatt Word
During his bad boy pomp though Not at the end when he was ravaged by the vicious tentacles of AIDS No one wants to see that at Wembley
I m genuinely tempted to swagger onto the pitch today dressed like Eazy E
Been up since 6am reading American Psycho and listening to Straight Outta Compton I m so fucking pumped I think I might rape myself
She took that a little thick and things did become quite frosty However we soon moved on and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal I had beef
Skin I have a fabulous rapport Weak as I am teased a roguish Big Sam You re not weak love You do look like Carlton Palmer mind
Lunch and a few cheeky cocktails with Skunk Anansie It s such a shame Christ died on a Friday because they really are fucking marvellous
Is 617 a Boston area code Somebody there has been ringing me all day Big Sam ain t got no time to answer though He has a playoff to win
This kid in Child s Play is such a fucking dweeb He dresses just like the fucking doll He deserves to be terrorised by the thing
But there is no escape There s nowhere to go Steve It s just you a deadly fucking doll And it s Big Sam The doll is big fucking Sam
And he s fucking crying He s fucking squealing all over the shop Help me Venky s Help me from escape from this nightmarish nightmare
Then BOOM The doll is all up in his grill tearing at his big bald face and destroying his whole defence with a range of swagger design
He s all like Haha Look at that stupid doll I discovered Phil Jones and he s all cocky and not having a fucking care in the world
Imagine Steve fucking Kean shaking in a court room waiting for Big Sam to strut in only to see a Cabbage Patch Doll walk through the door
I ve been trying it on a Cabbage Patch Doll for the best part of an hour fuck all has happened I m so sick of being lied to by Hollywood
Fuck this Child s Play is a wonderful motion picture but that spell is nothing but fabricated fucking hokum
Auday duay dumbalar Give me the power I beg of you La mwar de sway de pwa de yo Se swa seten de pwa de mor Auday deway dum balar Awake
Ayo lesson here Steve Kean You come at the king you best not miss
All that remained was friendship smiles togetherness and a melodic spiritual harmony you can t buy Not with all the money in Abu Dhabi
As quick as a whip Big Sam launches into La Bamba and a possible situation is pulled back from the brink of disaster
Sir Alex flashed me a look as cold damning as Baroness Warsi s muff I was cocooned in a terror both ethereal and very very real
At one point I let out a mournful guttural yelp It was staggeringly poignant but it basically sounded like I was just shouting Aguero
A few plucks of a steel guitar string with my long sensational fingers can relax that man into a state of almost catotonic splendour
Spent the morning on Skype with Sir Alex soothing his broken heart with some of the most gorgeous Portuguese Fado music you ll ever
No contest Big Sam is the Napoleon of the Championship pushing aside the papal idiocy of the playoffs and crowning himself as Emperor
So the deep fat fried oiks of Blackpool stand in my massive way at Wembley The tactical majesty of Big Sam versus Worzel fucking Gummidge
I might even slip on my vinyl copy of Untrue by Burial for this imminent fuckfest Those creeping moody beats do wonders for my stroke
I guess that s my message to all my loyal fans at Blackburn tonight Keep the faith It won t always be plunged right up your bangle
She stuck it out though Never complained took what was owed and made the best out of it And now she s about to get her rewards

This might sound like one of these internal skirmishes which will resolve itself if given time But it is not And there is very little time left The next CAF president will have a lot of work to do to right his Confederation again And that s leaving its finances aside
Well not really Or not clear But what s clear is that the Governance Committee is not happy with the way CAF s acting pres Omari is telling them what to do and how to do it as this memo makes pretty obvious To sum it up Mind your own business
Why would Omari be worried because the candidates must be cleared 60 days before the vote takes place and this vote is to take place on 12 March Oops That s less than 60 days away now which means Yahya and Motsepe should be disqualified no
Yahya in particular is furious And Fifa is not too happy either as I understand as by general consent he and Motsepe are its favoured candidates So Omari lets the Governance Com that it needs to come to a resolution asap That is unprecedented
In fact I ve never seen anything like it Recap the CAF Governance Committee has vetted two of the five candidates MM Anouma and Senghor Incumbent Ahmad has been disqualified currently under a 5 yr ban by Fifa Remaining two Yahya and Motsepe subject to extra checks
Just saw the Memorandum which Michel K Brizoua Bi pres of CAF s Governance Committee sent to acting CAF pres Constant Omari ExCo and GenSec about the eligibility of candidates to the CAF March election Crazy stuff Have to say I doubt that it ll take place at planned date

Calling for a referee here No penalty for Wolves we re agreed but shouldn t it have been an indirect free kick in the area under the dangerous play rule a very high foot by Mané Genuine question by the way Also because I love indirect fks in the area
Much as I admire Kane this needs to be addressed by referees before someone gets seriously injured No foul given either
So Arsenal crossed the ball let me check again 56 times against Tottenham Is that some kind of club record Moyes s Man United still leading the way in that respect in the division I believe 81 v Fulham in Feb 2014

A conversation I greatly enjoyed Thank you guys
When the black dog comes to the door I fear that the world in which this song was written and recorded is gone for good which is probably why I m so shaken at hearing it again tonight
That coda which we sang together when Ayako s voice soars through one of my favourite key changes still sounds arresting to me But what I hear most of all is musicians from all over the world uniting in music It may sound trite but nothing is more precious to me
A familiar feeling Every song you finish is the best in the flush of completion But the record lovely as it was didn t do much Yet I never forgot it and tonight I discovered that someone had posted it on YouTube eight years ago
Timo s arrangement remained faithful to the original harmonies but introduced a modal element which was completely foreign to me at the time I loved it as I loved singing with Ayako and when we d finished I was certain that this was one of the best things I d ever done
I was surrounded by far far more competent musicians than I am all of them graduates from the Sibelius Academy I wondered what Timo would make of my Butterfly Blue which I d demoed with just my voice and a 12 string guitar Then I wondered at what he d done with it
The accordion player in that band was the extraordinary Maria Kalaniemi Listen to her album Kaamos if you can it is magical Winter still lingered The ferry that took me to Suomenlinna was still sailing through ice Just perfect for a first visit to Sibelius s country
A short melancholy thread One of the happiest moments of my musical life was when my friend Ayako Hirakata asked me to write a song for her album Blue My immense luck was that she d got Timo Alakotila to compose the band arrangement We d record it in Helsinki Yes
It s tempting to go ha ha you idiots at this But this is what the whole Europe is the enemy narrative feeds on It s a pile of lies yes but it panders to exceptionalism and entitlement in others words it is irresistible It is also frightening

They played everywhere in parks schools factories universities That last scene in The Queen s Gambit just gets it Yes Soviet taxi drivers and park sweepers gathered round the wireless to listen to the update from the big tournament replayed the games on their cheap sets
Even Petrossian the boa constrictor Chess was taught in Soviet schools To the Party it was a means to show the world the USSR was number one To the ordinary citizens it was a means to escape tyranny and much more than that a path to artistic beauty and freedom
I was not a Communist But chess wise I was on the side of the Soviets Most of the real artists at the board were Soviets They played imaginative risky glamorous chess Bronstein Spassky Geller my hero then and forever Mikhail Tal Stein Keres Nezhmetdinov
I ve loved The Queen s Gambit for many reasons one of which the most important to me being that it got the romance of the Soviet game just right in its final episode A shortish thread about what it was to be a chess fan growing up when the USSR ruled over 64 squares

Challenge him By all means Discuss what constitutes cheating in various cultures By all means too A fascinating subject But this kind of sanctimonious and perfunctory apology No not for me
I m glad it isn t Souness s view of Latin sneakiness may be tainted and clumsily expressed but it isn t false in essentia It has a historical and cultural grounding which we should not brush away because it affects our sensitivities Whose btw Not mine And I m a Latin
But the point is we think we live in a world where footballing cultures have somehow blended into a single global perception of what is right and wrong for the game and therefore we can call out the people who step beyond the lines we ve imagined This isn t the case
Neither did it prevent Nobby Stiles from committing one of the worst fouls in WC history when he broke Jacques Simon s leg in a crucial group game England carried on playing and scored That s shithousery on a different level The manly game can be also the most hypocritical
As I was telling earlier on this didn t prevent Jack Charlton from handling the ball on his goal line as sneakily as he could not very well in England s win over Portugal in the 1966 World Cup
So a Scotchman thinks we Latins have a propensity to be cute I don t have a problem with that It s just the way he describes how his own football culture perceives our own Our own perception of the British game is just as prejudiced believe me
I consider myself Latin with some reason a good part of my family comes from Marseille French football is essentially Latin football regardless of where our players parents grandparents came from i e everywhere This is our culture which we claim and are proud of
Sky thought it fit to apologise for the stereotyping of Latin football in its coverage If the apology were needed it should have been left to Souness to present it This kind of public disowning humiliation doesn t sit well with me at all

Given United s penalty penchant it will be interesting to see if there is an incident inside the area in front of The Kop minus fans The last possible time mufc scored a spotkick up that end was in 1953 Roger Byrne

Solskjaer against circuit break idea floated by Allardyce It is not a coincidence that some clubs with lots to lose have been at the forefront of resisting restarts proposing breaks mufc

For such a great talent United never seem to miss Pogba however they play and they are moving on from him with their new signings mufc
United needing only a point from last two group games is the perfect position to be in despite defeat in Istanbul Cavani quality tonight despite no goal Van de Beek impressive in deeper role and Fernandes talismanic again mufc
Terrific win overall from mufc despite second half performance Player ratings
Matic coming on which says it all about the way the game s going mufc
United in danger of making one of the easiest wins they ve had in ages turn into a draw Complacency rife mufc
That ball was about as much over the line as Pedro Mendes shot
Might be misleading due to behind closed doors games but De Gea sounds a lot more vocal since Henderson came in to compete with him Struggled to make himself heard in first games post restart but he s chirping more than an Australian wicketkeeper tonight mufc
Lindelof off for Tuanzebe mufc
Tuanzebe coming on in the second half mufc
HT ratings from an excellent mufc performance
A post restart performance from United game won early and five substitutions to make Perfect evening so far Front six excellent mufc
Solskjaer has been much more demanding than usual despite United s imperiousness Just given Wan Bissaka a right rollocking mufc
And that should be game over Selfless of Fernandes to let Rashford take when he was on a hat trick mufc
And Fernandes has handed the ball to Rashford
There was a discussion going on about who would take United s penalty and two balls were on the pitch Martial kicked one towards the spot until Fernandes reminded him he s the taker Cavani seemed to ask mufc
Make that 21 United goals for Fernandes Basaksehir have had their day in the sun and this should be a rout mufc
Cavani s number not doing him justice tonight Looked every inch the specialist No 9 up there and his deft touches are bringing teammates into play quickly Helps Basaksehir are looking like the group s wooden spoon recipients this week mind mufc
That s 20 goals in 35 games for United from Fernandes and that was possibly the best Utterly unsaveable mufc get the early breathrough they failed to get on Saturday and it could now be a comfortable evening
Goodness me What a hit from Fernandes mufc
Rashford definitely lining up on the right contrary to the BT graphic just then mufc
Pogba having more problems with his ankle Issue if this is just minor or in some way related to last season s injury
As potent as United s attack looks who s the right winger Martial and Rashford have never liked playing there and have seldom played well there Martial was much more active when he moved to the left on Saturday mufc
Henderson s omission a surprise as he was told to expect to start both Basaksehir games Solskjaer has also possibly undermined what he said yesterday about Henderson playing more than one game before Everton on December 23 Almost solely depends on De Gea s form mufc
mufc De Gea Wan Bissaka Lindelof Maguire Telles Van de Beek Fred Rashford Fernandes Martial Cavani
Fitting programme cover tonight mufc
The timing of his signing and nationality made it inevitable Fernandes would be mentioned in the same breath as Cantona and Ronaldo One thing he s likely to beat them at is penalties for mufc mufc
Obviously Martial has fewer goals this season and his goalscoring record for France is dismal but interesting he s usually scrutinised more than Rashford who was worse on Saturday and squandered an easy chance Martial also arguably had the better season in 19 20 mufc
Mason Greenwood was involved in mufc s training session today so he could make his first start since the Arsenal defeat
There are seven games between Basaksehir and Everton and Solskjaer has suggested Henderson will play in one of them mufc
Solskjaer relaxed about Anthony Martial s form amid scrutiny over his goalscoring records this season and for France mufc
Agree with Solskjaer on CL squads I like the size of the squads because the players feel involved especially during lockdown Sometimes if you re told you re not in the squad you ve got to stay at home and you can t go and see your friend or see the game with a friend mufc
Jesse Lingard self isolating after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus Luke Shaw could be out for over a month but Pogba due to be back tomorrow for mufc Solskjaer also suggested Henderson could play again before Everton QF tie on December 23
Dean Henderson expecting to start for United against Basaksehir mufc
Mea culpa Fernandes actually has as many penalty goals for United as Denis Irwin Forgot Wrexham 95 sorry He has overtaken George Best for penalty goals though according to the faultless website
Solskjaer hopeful Greenwood will spark improved performances from United when he returns mufc
Solskjaer It s definitely not a step forward performance wise This one was way below par mufc
Can remember David Coote producing one of the most amateurish refereeing performances in the 2011 Youth Cup tie between Liverpool and United He was bad from the off tonight and even mufc s penalty shouldn t have been allowed to happen due to the foul by Fred
United win 1 0 and are indebted to De Gea in a pandemic era tribute to Louis van Gaal albeit with more shooting mufc MUNWBA
That was a win s a win kind of win for mufc West Brom were unlucky not to take a point and despite the quantity of Johnstone s saves none matched the quality or importance of De Gea s at 0 0
Sam Johnstone was the man of the match and United s best player was also their keeper mufc player ratings MUNWBA
Says it all about United s performance McTominay has been sent on to protect the lead None of the forwards have performed Rashford never looked on it mufc
Van de Beek coming on mufc
Good bottle from Fernandes Had three penalties saved this season but two haven t counted PSG and West Brom and he converted with both retakes mufc
Solskjaer knew it was going to be retaken before the referee there Madness Johnstone has to know better Dudek like mufc
Furlong close to the ball but daft to raise his arm like that West Brom will understandably feel aggrieved after their penalty dubiously didn t stand mufc
Not sure if Coote could be heard on mic but he said Played the ball United really lucky there
Penalty overturned
Van de Beek has just started warming up and he might be needed soon mufc
United are crying out for someone more creative deeper Van de Beek Fernandes getting frustrated he s withdrawing to the halfway line at times and feels like Solskjaer has overestimated the 18th placed winless side by selecting Matic mufc
Tuanzebe and James warming up at half time Neither look set to come on straight away though mufc
HT ratings from a tepid mufc performance MUNWBA
United haven t been scintillating but have had the openings to be ahead Solskjaer just told Fernandes to get further forward but he decided to hang back as if he s having more joy in a deeper role mufc
Alex run it forward Alex Alex Maguire not happy with Telles for not advancing with the ball mufc
Even the usually regal Old Trafford teamsheets have been compromised by the cyber attack mufc
And if United beat West Brom they ll go above City tonight mufc
Difficult to accurately gauge the quality of teams in this upside down world of pandemic era football but only Chelsea have scored more goals than Spurs and they ve gone from 14th to first under Mourinho in a year He has improved them in just about every way
MUTV say Pogba is out with a knock mufc
No Pogba as reported earlier One surprise is Matic for McTominay but Matic obviously didn t play during the international fortnight mufc
Tributes to late 68 final starters on display mufc
Solskjaer says in programme players who have been on duty had to have a COVID test and could only train once they had received a negative result which can take 24 hours At the time of writing I m not sure we will get all our results in time for final training session mufc
United squad vs West Brom mufc
Marcus Rashford Victor Lindelof and Alex Telles all included in mufc squad for today Paul Pogba not with the squad when United arrived at The Lowry Unclear if he ll rendezvous with teammates later
United ummed and ahhed about signing a left back for over two years before Alex Telles joined Solskjaer no longer worried about the position and encouraged by Brandon Williams s training form mufc
Pogba unlikely to secure a fixed position again if when he gets back in the United side mufc
Candid interview with Smalling and evidence players need an objective voice to advise them Interesting he seemed so surprised by his role going into last season when all the signs during that pre season were he was going to make way for Maguire mufc
Pogba feeling stronger after three starts with France mufc
Think what Solskjaer meant about Greenwood s absence was he spent over a week away from training recently Club released picture of Greenwood at Carrington on Monday mufc
Solskjaer on one point from 12 at home in the league It s a different sensation now playing without the fans behind the goal in the Stretford End They usually score a goal for us mufc
Eric Bailly back in training for United but Tuanzebe set to start if Lindelof isn t risked Full mufc team news
Solskjaer on Greenwood If we go a year back I left him out of the Carabao Cup against Chelsea Mason stayed back and played against Doncaster in the Checkatrade That s how far he s come Says Greenwood spent eight or nine days away from Carrington due to illness mufc
United hopeful Rashford will be fit for tomorrow but Lindelof a doubt due to back problem Greenwood also a doubt due to illness mufc
Sir Alex Ferguson stumbled on some unlikely solutions in midfield and the indispensable Fred has succeeded in a similar vein mufc
Edinson Cavani believed to be back at Carrington today so good chance he will be in the squad for West Brom mufc
Manner of recruitment with incomings and outgoings near faultless by United at academy level with local lads retained as a duty of care before moving to Burnley mufc
The five subs rule would solve a conundrum for United but until its inevitable return something is going to have to give with their midfield six mufc
Why United are so excited about Amad Diallo mufc
United finalising final details of Amad Diallo transfer ahead of scheduled January arrival mufc
Raphael Varane eluded United in 2011 and they ended up with Phil Jones Ten years on an opportunity is emerging to sign Varane and sell Jones mufc
United still need a centre back a defensive midfielder and a winger but chances of a Fernandes style mid season buy are slim They need to start selling mufc
United prioritise player sales in January mufc
In the latest issue of Private Eye
Agree with Solskjaer on timing of mufc fixture and clubs need to push back such daft times If better advised he d have addressed it pre match as it would ve moved on from Basaksehir quicker and ramped up the siege mentality Doing it yesterday overshadowed a terrific win
Solskjaer gave the clearest explanation yesterday as to why McTominay and Fred are starting together so much mufc
United won t be complaining but perverse Fred doesn t get in the Brazil squad and Allan does Arsenal was an aberration and he was terrific again today Nigh on indispensable with the way mufc are set up and he s had a really good year or so since Norwich away
Alex Telles s return well timed with United concerned about Luke Shaw Three more added to the injured ill list Mason Greenwood is on mufc
Attempt is made to lighten the mood about Fernandes s performance Solskjaer I don t really want to lighten the mood Very happy with Bruno and the performance It fixture scheduling s such a serious issue in the times we re in that we don t look after these players mufc
Solskjaer s full diatribe against the authorities scheduling of today s mufc game
Get in there Harry Maguire roared at full time Solskjaer got what he demanded from his United players today mufc EVEMUN
Potentially Maguire s best performance for mufc certainly best since his debut against Chelsea McTominay and Fred are developing a bit of a Hargreaves Anderson partnership Easy to see why Solskjaer entrusts those two over the starrier midfielders
Gutsy win by United Fernandes fantastic Maguire had his best game for months and the two in midfield were excellent mufc
Big win for United Four 8 10s in player ratings mufc EVEMUN
That free kick almost cost United Doucoure should have snatched a point but Fernandes superb on the breakway to set up Cavani mufc
Maguire Paul the corner His advice wasn t heeded there mufc
Pogba coming on mufc
Telles and Williams were both fit enough to be in the provisional squad but neither on the bench Makes it especially galling for mufc that Shaw went off hurt
Tuanzebe coming on mufc
Not sure how that isn t a penalty Apparently even Pete fence sitter Walton says it was
Pickford mimicking his Anfield clanger there albeit not under his own crossbar this time Senseless to drop him one week only to recall him the next
All the mufc outfield subs have warmed up Mata maybe the obvious withdrawal but not obvious who should replace him Have to wonder whether the energy issues Solskjaer spoke of pre match will come into play now
If this ends 2 1 Fernandes will have scored United s winners in all three Premier League games this season His performance level has dipped but he does not lack bottle mufc
mufc HT ratings from Goodison EVEMUN
Impressive half from mufc before and after Bernard scored Midfield choice has been vindicated so far and Fernandes back in form Shaw good Seamus Coleman looking more like Tony Hibbert these days
Newcastle away style response from United mufc have exposed this Everton defence for how bad it is when they have had a go at them Coleman struggled against United even at his peak
Two assists in a week for Luke Shaw Alex Telles just being fit again has had some impact on United Fine header by Fernandes Both of these defences are dependent on their midfield twos to shore them up Had to be goals in this game mufc
United playetrs look gutted at the manner of that and it s easy to see why Undone by a long ball a knock on and De Gea beaten at his near post mufc
Jordan Pickford yelling Danger Danger Possibly talking about himself EVEMUN
Past and present here Gill and Woodward mufc
No experienced right winger whatsoever in the mufc squad again Solskjaer was given the chance to lament the hierarchy s failure to sign him one yesterday
Possible ulterior motive of omitting Telles completely is to ensure he doesn t travel to South America for Brazil s World Cup qualifiers this month Today s team was always going to be contentious but can see logic of the selections mufc
Solskjaer reverts to McTominay Fred axis to shore up mufc No surprise Pogba is dropped from Arsenal No Greenwood as reported so Mata starts on the right
A grand old team and a grand old ground This particular place is really not the same without matchgoers EVEMUN
Podcast on Pochettino and personal background on the Mourinho sacking which explains mufc s predictable stance Apple Spreaker
Solskjaer We have planted a seed the tree is growing Some clubs just rip up that tree and see if it is still growing and see if it is still getting water underneath mufc
United squad vs Everton mufc

So Trump goes today A horrible and dangerous period of leadership ends He normalised mistruth and divided a nation Whilst they aren t as bad as the Trump administration the current UK government have similar traits This type of politics must end Let s hope today is the start
No I like him and he was one of the few opposing managers in Spain when I was there that spoke to me I just don t get that 44 pts under Rafa is amazing and 44 pts under Steve Bruce is shocking Newcastle fans have been let down but not by any manager
Of course and Rafa was paid 6m a year because of that He s a great manager but even he couldn t give the Newcastle fans good football and any success It was awful to watch
I would rather have Ritchie Rondon and Perez over this lot SB has the same points as Rafa in a season more points at this stage than both Rafa seasons He played the media better inc Carragher who was sharing helicopter trips back to Liverpool where he lived after games
Yes where is that

Weasel fair enough but I m very clean
Anyway good morning all Attack the hell out of this day
It certainly is A pre historic structure that won t modernise The game needs an independent regulator to drive a bus through football governance
The FA criticising any other party for lack of Diversity and Inclusion training is hypocrisy at its best I m sure I saw an FA chairman in front a commons select committee 6 weeks ago represent their own training programme really well

Question Does football continue in scotland with national lockdown or is it stopped
Yeah The front 3 are s and the back 4 are horrible to watch but keep their team in the game

A very different time When we didn t know how the virus was behaving and the unknowns were great
Can we please get this two week circuit breaker thing off the table The players would have to carry on mixing and training to be ready in 2 weeks for a match They may get 4 5 days off What is that going to do Would have to be a long break to do anything meaningful
Forget the Vaccine and United being second in the league the biggest news of the day is Philip Neville is back on Twitter Welcome back Philip Avicii Hey Brother via
Batshit crazy
You new here
Football has proven through the last 6 months it can operate safely It was right to be cautious and concerned through the first lockdown when the virus was new and unknown It shouldn t stop now in my opinion This virus isn t going anywhere in 2 4 weeks
That s what it s like here too I m surprised it was called off that early
Not sure they will but I think will be watching closely

They released 5 key criteria 2 weeks ago to measure Tiers by Manchester is lower than many T2 areas were 2 weeks ago Today the government ignored their own criteria The biggest set of charlatans to be ever elected
A must watch The King
Announcement on the Tiers tomorrow now How could you ever think this is right Have you any idea what chaos you are causing Why did London get notification ahead of plan not that it was helpful for London but the rest have to wait an extra day Joke

Raiola It s happened many times before However surely Paul knew he was making this announcement If he wasn t aware then we should see a quote from him very soon correcting his agent Finally to do this ahead of Leipzig and the Man Derby is terrible timing for the Team

Strange Why
They said we had to prove that we had a CV case within one mile that resulted in us closing and that we didn t close due to other reasons We are still going as we believe like many others we should be paid out
We have paid BI insurance for years and they won t pay out Due to technicalities So many in the same boat made a speech in parliament stating insurers needed to pay It s not happening

Good morning Countydog
Raab Gove and Rees Mogg will throw under a bus when this is over prior to getting out before the next election They are leaving them in now as shields Horrible bunch
This government have had some tough calls to make They ve made decisions that have been questionable good and bad Maybe that was always going to happen with this being a unique situation However its the way they have drained us of confidence and trust
I was playing football Steve
The issue with the 3 4 3 within the last two games is you end up with 8 inc GK defensive positionally rigid players on the pitch If you add Harry Kane to that who is more of a fixed Striker you have 9 players that don t interchange and rotate It s a little predictable
No But that s where the negotiations must happen on the control points
True The EFL clubs need this to come off The 14 need to get round the table and negotiate with the 6 and come to an agreement
Listen to this one Honestly
It s not Hospitality
But that can never happen and be introduced as a condition Even little things like the community shield going No need It s a part of the fabric
Correct from conn Their are parts of the proposal that require negotiation but their is too much good in this plan to dismiss it Let s get round the table please PL EFL FA FSF If it suits 9 PL clubs and maybe 72 EFL clubs then let s work with the other 11
Join us at 4pm if you like for England v Belgium

Morning Tim

Right happy weekend all Leeds v Man City today and United v Spurs tomorrow for me Join us if you like Come on
They Know My View
We need to govern ourselves and should introduce measures for us Ones that protect safety but are also supported by common sense
Panic Buy They ve needed these positions filling for 12 months had a national lockdown to regroup and re set and ample time to manoeuvre deals to a conclusion
It s appalling that in this market which is probably the easiest in PL history to get transfers done that United haven t done more yet They must get Ole a CB LB and Forward pre deadline The others are managing to get things over the line why not United
I d do what they did in the 90 s Get a right winger that can
It was just nice to see you in a again Order restored

Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on Southampton s 2019 20 accounts when pre tax loss widened from 41m to 76m as revenue fell 23m 15 to 127m COVID impact 31m and profit on player sales down 7m to 14m Debt up from 32m to 92m SaintsFC
For those Southampton fans who would prefer a more concise executive summary here s a 2 page overview of their 2019 20 accounts SaintsFC
Thread on Southampton s 2019 20 financial results when their pre tax loss widened from 41m to 76m as revenue fell 23m 15 from 150m to 127m COVID impact 31m and profit on player sales down from 21m to 14m Debt up from 32m to 92m SaintsFC
On the pitch SaintsFC continue to make progress under Ralph Hasenhüttl but these financial results highlight the challenges that the pandemic poses to all football clubs plus Southampton s reliance on profitable player trading The loss necessitated taking on much more debt
Owner Gao Jisheng has not invested any money into SaintsFC as he wants the club to be self sustaining It has been reported in the media that the Chinese businessman is keen to sell his 80 stake but he remains the owner for the time being
No owner funding for SaintsFC in the last 5 years which is a big change Instead generated 63m from operations and 62m from external loans Invested 19m in infrastructure repaid 13m owner loans had 11m net player purchases and 10m interest Cash balance up 72m
SaintsFC cash rose from 47m to 87m 4th highest in the Premier League However this is a bit misleading as it is largely due to the new loan Steele While the cash reserves remain in a good place the losses being made every month will continue eating into that figure
SaintsFC generated 15m cash from operations then spent 33m net on player purchases 3m on capital expenditure mainly hospitality areas at the stadium and 1m interest This was funded by 62m of bank loans giving net cash inflow of 40m
Worth noting that SaintsFC have reduced transfer fees debt stage payments from 90m to 55m There is 12m owed by other clubs so net payable is 43m In addition 30m contingent liabilities potentially payable mainly dependent on player appearances
SaintsFC paid 1 1m interest down from 2 0m but this will increase due to MSD 78 8m loan charging a hefty 9 14 7 2m a year The other 12 5m of bank loans is at 1 065 Some Premier League clubs have much higher charges though many owners provide interest free loans
Despite the increase SaintsFC 92m gross debt is fairly standard for the Premier League Five clubs owe more than 200m THFC 831m lead the way new stadium followed by MUFC 526m EFC 409m BHAFC 280m and AFC 209m Other clubs will have increased debt in 2019 20
Managing Director Toby Steele was at pains to emphasise that the big loan the club took out just before the accounts closed was absolutely to mitigate against the effects of COVID 19 and not to fund transfer spend a war chest for January or the summer
SaintsFC gross debt rose sharply from 32m to 92m largely comprising 78m loan from MSD Holdings repayable in 2025 and 12m bank loan repayable in 2 equal instalments over next 2 years Previous 20m working capital facility repaid during the year
SaintsFC annual gross transfer spend averaged 60m in last 6 years but 45m player sales means that net spend has only been 15m The 2020 21 accounts will include acquisitions of Ibrahim Diallo Brest Kyle Walker Peters THFC and Mohammed Salisu Valladolid
SaintsFC spent 24m on player purchases including Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo down from 67m prior year and 86m in 2018 Fairly low for the Premier League though clubs did cut back expenditure last season That said Southampton have splashed out 361m in last 6 years
As a result SaintsFC 57m player amortisation has more than doubled in just 3 years though is still mid table in the Premier League just behind WHUFC For some perspective it is around than a third of big spending CFC 168m
SaintsFC player amortisation the annual charge to write down transfer fees over the life of a player s contract rose by 6m 15 from 51m to 57m Also booked 6 4m impairment charge to reduce the value of certain players maybe Guido Carrillo up from prior year s 2 3m
SaintsFC directors remuneration nearly halved from 2m to 1 2m with the highest paid director seeing pay decrease from 728k to 598k This is relatively low for the Premier League especially compared to MUFC 3 1m and THFC 3 0m
The increase in SaintsFC wages to turnover ratio to 90 means that this is the highest worst in the Premier League just above EFC 89 though could be overtaken when other clubs publish 2019 20 accounts Excluding impact of the pandemic it would have fallen to 72
SaintsFC 114m wage bill is currently 11th highest in Premier League around 50m below EFC 165m though other clubs wages may well drop when 2019 20 accounts are published
SaintsFC wage bill slightly decreased by 1m 1 to 114m which means that wages have been essentially flat for the last 4 years but over that period the wages to turnover ratio has worsened from 62 to 90 due to the fall in revenue
SaintsFC ended their club record shirt sponsorship reportedly 7 5m a year with Chinese company LD Sports after only 12 months of 3 year agreement replaced by for 2020 21 Kit supplier deal is with Under Armour while sleeve sponsor is Virgin Media
SaintsFC commercial income fell 1m 6 from 20m to 19m though had been rising until COVID meant 5 7m revenue foregone and 1 6m deferred to 2020 21 due to reduction in conferences and postponement of Killers gig Firmly in bottom half of Premier League
As 4 games played behind closed doors SaintsFC average attendance fell from 30 139 to 23 428 though up to 29 675 for those games with fans in attendance Remained 14th highest in Premier League Prices reduced for two thirds of season ticket holders in 2019 20
SaintsFC match day revenue fell 3m 15 from 17m to 14m their lowest since 2012 due to the suspension of the season then playing 4 games behind closed doors after the resumption Income very low compared to the elite clubs e g THFC earn around 7 times as much 95m
It is worth noting the impact of European qualification on a club s broadcasting income especially the Champions League which was worth between 88m for MCFC and 61m for THFC in 2020 Europa League participants earn less but still ranged from 17m to 25m
As the 2019 20 season was extended beyond the June accounting close SaintsFC Premier League TV money was lower though 19m revenue has been deferred into 2020 21 accounts Accounts note that 2019 20 figure was based on estimated league position as of 30th June
SaintsFC broadcasting income slumped 20m 17 from 113m to 93m due to revenue from 6 games slipping to 2020 21 accounts plus rebate to broadcasters offset by better Premier League finishing position One of the lowest in PL but other clubs will also fall in 2019 20
Based on 2018 19 accounts SaintsFC were just outside the top 30 in the Deloitte Money League which ranks clubs globally by revenue They were 23rd the previous year and as high as 18th in 2016 17 That said they were only 4m below the 30th placed club
SaintsFC 15 revenue reduction over prior year in 2019 20 is in line with other clubs who have reported to date like MUFC 19 and THFC 15 EFC only saw a 1 decrease as their numbers included once off 30m payment for stadium naming rights option
Due to the impact of the pandemic SaintsFC 127m revenue looks like it is one of the smallest in the Premier League though other clubs are likely to be lower after they publish 2019 20 accounts Either way miles below the Big Six e g MUFC 509m CFC 407m THFC 392m
SaintsFC revenue has now fallen 3 years in a row by 31 from the 182m peak in 2017 to 127m in 2020 mainly due to less TV money absence of Europa League 13m and COVID impacted Premier League revenue though match day has also dropped 8m 35
At an operating level i e excluding player sales and interest SaintsFC loss increased from 60m to 87m Very few Premier League clubs post operating profits but Southampton s loss is currently one of the highest this season though nowhere near as bad as EFC 175m
SaintsFC EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered a proxy for cash operating profit as it strips out player sales and exceptional items fell from 4 m to 16 m the worst in the Premier League though likely to be overtaken by others
SaintsFC have now reported losses in the last two seasons totaling 117m which has almost entirely wiped out the preceding five consecutive profitable years which were worth 126m in total including 42m in 2017 and 35m in 2018
That said SaintsFC profit from player sales has declined 2 years in a row from 69m in 2018 mainly Virgin van Dijk to LFC to 21m in 2019 then 14m in 2020 The 2021 accounts will include the sales of Pierre Emile Höjbjerg to THFC and Harrison Reed to FFC
Player trading has been a key part of the SaintsFC strategy In the 5 years up to 2018 19 they made a hefty 205m profit from this activity with only CFC 332m and LFC 306m ahead of them For more context AFC MCFC and MUFC only made 170m 147m and 60m respectively
SaintsFC explained that their ability to generate profits from player trading was significantly impacted by the summer 2020 transfer window not opening until July after the financial year ended Transfer market also depressed by the pandemic reducing clubs spending power
SaintsFC profit from player sales fell from 21m to 14m mainly Gallagher to BRFC and Austin to WBA plus add ons from previously sold players Premier League profits from this activity lower in 2019 20 e g MUFC 18m and THFC 15m are similar to Southampton
Without COVID SaintsFC revenue would have been 31m higher at 158m i e 8m 5 higher than prior year 21m deferred to 2020 21 accounts and 10m foregone Allied to 2m net cost saving the loss would have been only 43m around the same as 2018 19
SaintsFC 76m loss before tax is 2nd highest to date in 2019 20 Premier League only surpassed by EFC 140m but better than THFC 68m and MUFC 21m Due to the pandemic it is likely that other clubs will also post substantial losses when they publish their 19 20 accounts
SaintsFC wage bill fell slightly by 1m 1 to 114m while other expenses were 9m 24 lower at 29m On the other hand player amortisation rose 6m 11 to 57m and there were 10 8m exceptional costs player impairment 6 4m and onerous contracts 4 4m up from 2 3m
SaintsFC 23m revenue fall was driven by broadcasting s 19m 17 decrease from 113m to 94m mainly due to 6 Premier League games being played after 30 June accounts close Match day was also down 2 6m 15 to 14 5m while commercial dipped 1 1m 6 to 18 7m
SaintsFC pre tax loss widened from 41m to 76m as revenue fell 23m 15 from 150m to 127m and profit on player sales decreased 7m from 21m to 14m while total expenses grew 5m Loss after tax increased from 34m to 62m
Southampton s 2019 20 financial results covered a successful season when they improved their position in the Premier League from 16th to 11th under manager Ralph Hasenhüttl but their finances were significantly impacted by COVID 19 Some thoughts follow SaintsFC
This is all kinds of brilliant Burgess PARTY and the late very great Prince
Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on Milan s 2019 20 financial results where the club posted a club record post tax loss of 195m partly impacted by COVID as revenue fell 56m 25 Funded by large capital injections from their owners Milan
And for those who would prefer a more concise overview of Milan s 2019 20 financials here s a simple 2 page overview Milan
Thread on Milan s 2019 20 financial results where the club posted a club record post tax loss of 195m partly impacted by COVID as revenue fell 56m 25 Funded by large capital injections from their owners Milan
Like all other clubs Milan 2019 20 results have been hit by COVID but their operational performance was already suffering before the pandemic struck Their young team needs to continue to perform on the pitch as Champions League money is vital for the project to succeed
Despite UEFA relaxing their FFP rules e g adjusting for COVID losses and combining 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons the club still anticipates some form of future sanction However Gazidis confirmed that next evaluation will only take place in October 2021
Milan have had problems meeting Financial Fair Play regulations initially resulting in UEFA banning them for 2 years from European competitions This was overturned by CAS but the club eventually agreed a 1 year ban missing out on the Europa League in 2019 20
Milan have been very reliant on increases in capital from their owners including 145m from Elliott in 2019 20 plus a further 97m after the accounts closed making 507m in 3 years Since 2014 various owners have had to put in around 850m to cover the club s large losses
Milan cash balance fell from 13m to 11m Most Italian clubs hold very little cash with the exception of Napoli s incredible 124m It is likely that the balance at Inter 55m and Udinese 20m will be lower after they publish their detailed COVID impacted 2019 20 accounts
Milan have also been successful in reducing gross transfer debt in last 2 years from 172m to 76m falling from 119m to just 20m on a net basis i e considering amounts owed by other clubs Gross payables much lower than Juventus 301m Roma 191m and Napoli 143m
Thanks to Elliott s early repayment of the bonds Milan net interest payable is down to 6m from prior year s 10m a lot better than Roma 32m Inter 26m and Juventus 15m The rossoneri have reduced this expense from 23m in 2018 which is a positive from the owners
Milan 115m gross financial debt is by no means the highest in Italy and is below Inter 461m Goldman Sachs financing Juventus 396m mainly for new stadium and Roma 318m mainly bond issue Milan s debt was as high as 260m in 2013
Milan gross debt increased by 19m from 96m to 115m which is due to a factoring deal with Unicredit linked to future TV revenue Elliott repaid the bonds and shareholder loans from the previous Chinese ownership a couple of years ago
However in terms of gross spend Milan 515m were outpaced by both Juventus 758m partly the Ronaldo factor and Inter 525m In 2020 21 player purchases were only 28m including Tonali loan Hauge Rebic Saelemaekers and Kjaer
In fact over the last 4 seasons up to 2020 21 Milan have the highest net spend in Serie A with their 287m well ahead of Inter 208m Juventus 204m and Napoli 124m In contrast Atalanta and Roma had net sales of 43m and 27m respectively
Milan have really ramped up their expenditure in the transfer market with net spend of 287m in the last 4 years gross 515m though they put on the brakes this season In 2019 20 acquired Leao 30m Theo Hernandez 22m Bennacer 16m Duarte 11m and Krunic 9m
As a result Milan player amortisation of 95m is the fourth highest in Italy just ahead of Roma 94m though still a fair way behind Juventus 167m Inter 120m and Napoli 118m
Milan player amortisation the annual cost of writing off transfer fees rose 15m 18 from 80m to 95m which means this expense has more than doubled in 4 years from 44m in 2016 Talk of using recent law to suspend this charge in 20 21 accounts deferred to future
Milan wages to turnover ratio of 93 is 3rd highest in Italy only surpassed by Genoa and Roma This is a lot higher than Napoli 79 Juventus 70 and Inter 64 As Gazidis said we have to bring our wage bill down while increasing performance which is not easy to do
Nevertheless Milan 161m wage bill is still the third highest in Italy just ahead of Roma 155m and Napoli 141m However they are a long way below Juventus 284m and Inter 198m
Since 2016 Milan wages have slightly reduced while there have been significant increases at most of their rivals e g Inter 74m Juventus 63m and Napoli 56m Only Roma have seen a comparable lack of wages growth over this period
Milan wage bill fell 24m 13 from 185m to 161m but wages to turnover ratio increased from 81 to 93 following the steep revenue reduction In response to the pandemic the first team squad did not take a salary for the month of April equivalent to a 3 9m cut
Milan income from player loans income fell from 13m to 8m mainly Gustavo Gomez Palmeiras Suso Sevilla and Diego Laxalt Torino This is an important revenue stream for some Italian clubs with Milan only behind Inter s 9m but ahead of Roma and Atalanta both 7m
Milan Emirates shirt sponsorship has been extended to 2023 at 10m less than previous 14m but can now sell training sleeve and women s deals separately Much lower than Juve s Jeep deal recently increased to 45m Puma kit deal is worth 11m also running to 2023
Just 4 years ago Milan s commercial income was the highest in Italy but it has dropped 30m since then while Juve and Inter have grown by 83m and 65m in the same period Milan s revenue has been flat for last 3 seasons This is an area that Gazidis will look to improve
Milan commercial revenue rose 1m 1 to 77m as small falls in sponsorship and publicity were offset by other income This is the third highest in Italy but is significantly behind Juventus 186m and Inter 142m as Milan have lost much of their brand appeal
Milan and Inter have been working on a joint project to build a new stadium A plan has been approved by the council though it required some modifications which will preserve part of the iconic San Siro Discussions continue but chief executive Ivan Gazidis is optimistic
Milan average attendance decreased from 54 639 to 34 078 again due to 6 games being played behind closed doors This remained the 2nd highest in Italy only below Inter 41 558 though ahead of Lazio 28 263 Roma 26 956 and Juventus 25 062 who all saw similar falls to Milan
Milan match day income fell 10m 30 from 34m to 24m with reductions in domestic 9m and Europe 1m Adversely impacted by no European games and 6 home games behind closed doors due to COVID This was 3rd highest in Italy far below Juventus 49m and Inter 44m
Milan have only received 29m from Europe in the last 5 years miles behind Juventus 449m Roma 255m and Napoli 246m due to those clubs consistently qualifying for the Champions League in recent times Last time Milan earned decent money from Europe was 2014 38m
Although Milan qualified for the Europa League UEFA s FFP 1 year ban meant they could not participate in 2019 20 so lost out on 15m revenue per 18 19 Other Italian clubs took advantage with highest earners being Juventus 87m Napoli 70m Atalanta 57m Inter 57m
It is imperative that Milan qualify for Europe ideally the Champions League to boost their broadcasting income as the TV rights in Serie A are relatively low Indeed there were big increases in England and Spain in 2019 20 and France in 2020 21 while Italy was unchanged
In 2018 19 Milan received 77m TV money from Serie A 50 equal share 30 performance 15 last season 10 last 5 years 5 historical and 20 supporters However 2019 20 revenue was 27m lower as some income deferred to 2020 21 after a few games played in July August
Milan broadcasting revenue decreased 42m 40 from 105m to 63m mainly due to domestic TV dropping 27m 30 from 90m to 63m but also no UEFA prize money which was 15m prior year Top three earn much more Juventus 166m Napoli 121m and Inter 115m
Based on 2018 19 accounts Milan dropped 3 places from 18th to 21st in the Deloitte Money League which ranks clubs worldwide by revenue In 2004 it was a different story when they were ranked 3rd generating 83m more revenue than 10th placed club but are now 254m lower
That said Milan 25 revenue decrease in 2019 20 is one of the worst results of clubs that have so far published accounts with most managing to limit the damage to falls below 20 Juventus 18 Inter 18 Napoli 17 Only Roma are higher with 37
Due to COVID most clubs have seen revenue fall dramatically in 2020 so Milan 42m reduction excluding player loans is actually better than Roma 90m Inter 63m and Juventus 58m Atalanta and Fiorentina accounts closed in December i e before the pandemic
As a result Milan s 172m revenue is less than half of Juventus 407m and around 140m below Inter 311m They are now 4th highest in Italy having been overtaken by Napoli 179m though are ahead of Roma 149m and Atalanta 141m
Milan ongoing revenue has declined 75m 30 since 2013 from 247m to 172m mainly due to not qualifying for Champions League which has driven 56m reduction in broadcasting 21m fall in commercial By club s definition revenue down 86m 31 from 279m to 192m
Similarly Milan operating loss excluding profit from player sales and interest widened from 144m to 202m down from only 23m in 2014 The traditional Big Four Italian clubs all make large operating losses Juventus 234m Roma 195m and Inter 133m
Milan EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered a proxy for underlying profitability as it excludes once off items like player sales and exceptional items fell from 51 m to 76 m the second worst in Italy only ahead of Roma 90m
One reason Milan have struggled financially is they have been poor at selling players In the last 5 years they only made 72m profit here which is miles below Juventus 563m Roma 372m and Napoli 325m Not sold a single player for a profit above 20m in last 3 years
Unlike many leading clubs Milan have made very little from player sales In fact they have only averaged 11m profit a year since 2014 including actually losing money in two of those years This is a third of the 33m average reported in the preceding 3 year period
It is worth noting the impact of exceptional costs which have increased Milan losses by 146m since 2014 The 2019 20 accounts included 20m player write downs mainly Andre Silva Paqueta Rodriguez and Reina and 10m provisions for management changes restructuring etc
Milan have lost an incredible 735m in last 7 years before tax In fact it s really 6 5 years as 2017 was only 6 months after the change in accounting date from December to June That means an average annual loss of 113m over this period
Milan profit on player sales rose 3m to 15m mainly Cutrone to WWFC 17m Embelo to Lille 3m offset by losses for Piatek to Hertha 4m Borini to Verona 1m One of smallest gains from this activity in Italy significantly lower than Juventus 167m Napoli 96m
COVID has reduced Milan revenue in 2019 20 by an estimated 42m broadcasting 27m Serie A revenue after 30 June deferred to 2020 21 match day 10m and commercial 5m Without this loss reported revenue would have been 214m i e only 6 below prior year
Clearly COVID has had a major adverse impact on finances in 2019 20 with many leading clubs across Europe reporting horrific losses e g Everton 158m Barcelona 97m and Tottenham Hotspur 72m but Milan 195m is one of the highest worst
Milan s huge 195m post tax loss is almost the worst in Italy only surpassed by Roma 204m while Inter 102m and Juventus 90m also posted hefty deficits impacted by COVID Note some clubs have 31 December year end so their 2019 20 accounts do not reflect the pandemic
Milan wage bill was cut 24m 13 from 185m to 161m while other expenses were down 7m 8 to 88m Player amortisation rose 14m 18 to 95m while player write downs increased 18m from 2m to 20m Net interest decreased 4m from 10m to 6m
As a technical aside this international definition of Milan 172m revenue is different to the one used in the club accounts which also includes 20m gain on player sales plus a tiny increase in asset values giving revenue of 192m down 49m 20 from prior year 241m
Milan largest revenue decrease came from broadcasting down 42m 40 from 105m to 63m though match day also fell 10m 31 from 34m to 24m and player loans were down 5m to 8m Commercial was slightly higher up 1m to 77m
Milan pre tax loss widened from 143m to 192m post tax 195m the worst result in club s history partly due to COVID as revenue fell 56m 25 from 228m to 172m while profit on player sales up 3m to 15m Expenses slightly lower including 30m exceptionals
Milan 2019 20 accounts cover a season when they finished 6th in Serie A and reached the semi final of the Coppa Italia but were excluded from Europe for FFP issues Second season under the ownership of American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation Some thoughts follow
Manchester United have published figures for their highest paid director with Ed Woodward s 2019 20 remuneration 3 087m down from prior year 3 160m but highest in Premier League above Daniel Levy s 2 959m Earned 21m since taking over from David Gill in July 2013 MUFC
Final call for today s thread on RealMadrid 2019 20 accounts where COVID 19 impact reduced their pre tax profit from 53m to 2m 313k after tax as revenue dropped 42m 6 from 757m to 715m Boosted by 101m profit from player sales
Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on RealMadrid 2019 20 accounts where COVID 19 impact reduced their pre tax profit from 53m to 2m 313k after tax as revenue dropped 42m 6 from 757m to 715m Boosted by 101m profit from player sales
And for those who would prefer a more concise overview of RealMadrid 2019 20 financial results here s a 2 page overview
Thread on Real Madrid 2019 20 accounts where COVID 19 impact reduced their pre tax profit from 53m to 2m 313k after tax as revenue dropped 42m 6 from 757m to 715m Boosted by 101m profit from player sales RealMadrid
RealMadrid have had a clear strategy success on the pitch leads to higher revenue allowing them to pay more to players This model has worked well for many years but has stalled partly due to COVID The Bernabéu stadium development will also represent a major challenge
Since 2012 RealMadrid have used over half of their available 1 1 bln cash on player purchases 653m but have also invested 318m into stadium improvements and Real Madrid City They also spent 113m on tax and 21m on interest while increasing cash balance by 40m
RealMadrid are a cash machine generating 1 1 bln from operations in the last 9 years though this has fallen from 195m in 2016 to 18m in 2020 when they spent 117m net on players 68m capex and 11m tax leading to 176m fall in cash offset by 155m new loans
Using broadest possible definition of debt RealMadrid total liabilities shot up from 606m to 901m in 2020 including 139m staff wages 132m accruals 50m trade creditors 21m tax Despite the increase still lower than THFC MUFC Barcelona all above 1 2 bln
Most clubs now use transfer debt i e stage payments as a form of financing so RealMadrid 116m gross transfer debt not that high in 2019 far behind Barcelona 261m Juventus 221m and MUFC 213m though that changed after the 2019 20 transfer campaign
RealMadrid transfer fees debt rose from 16m to 196m while amounts owed by other clubs are up to 91m giving net payables of 105m On the one hand this is much higher than position 2 years ago but on the other hand only half as much as 211m net debt 11 years ago
RealMadrid actually had 1m net interest receivable in 2019 20 much better than the position at their rivals who both had to pay out substantial interest on loans Atletico Madrid 34m and Barcelona 28m This will change as Madrid s stadium development debt ramps up
Based purely on financial debt RealMadrid 83m in 2018 19 was one of the lowest in Europe miles below THFC 746m new stadium MUFC 580m and Juventus 473m Will further rise with stadium loans another 275m in July 2020 and 200m in July 2021
RealMadrid cash balances decreased from 156m to 135m Despite the postponement of the collection of membership fees and some sponsorship money cash was boosted by the club taking on additional debt just before the semi annual wage payment in July
After 4 years when they enjoyed net funds RealMadrid swung to 354m net debt in 2019 20 241m financial debt plus 114m stadium This is per the club s definition which includes transfer debt Bank borrowings rose from 50m to 205m to compensate for COVID losses
Even in gross spend RealMadrid s 589m over the last five years was only the third highest in Spain obviously well below Barcelona s massive 1 044m but also behind Atletico Madrid s 668m As La Liga president Javier Tebas said clubs are now looking to reduce costs
Based on Transfermarkt figures RealMadrid only had 56m net spend in the last five seasons including 99m net sales in 2020 21 to date This was the fourth highest in La Liga around 300m less than Barcelona s 359m in this period but only just ahead of Getafe 52m
RealMadrid have splashed the cash in the transfer market in the last two years with 571m gross spend 308m net spend This included 323m purchases in 2019 20 partly offset by 139m sales However they made no purchases at all in the 2020 summer transfer window
RealMadrid total amortisation of 177m including 18m depreciation is the highest in Spain ahead of Barcelona 160m 2018 19 and Atletico Madrid 135m Reflects 2019 20 purchases of the likes of Hazard Jovic Militao Mendy Rodrygo and Reinier
The other RealMadrid staff cost player amortisation the annual charge to write down transfer fees over the length of a player s contract has significantly risen by 55m 53 from 104m to 159m which means this expense has increased by 76m 91 in just 2 years
Following the decrease in revenue RealMadrid wages to turnover ratio worsened from 48 to 53 still one of the lowest in Spain much better than Barcelona 59 and Atletico Madrid 63 In 2018 19 they had one of the best ratios in Europe miles better than say Juventus 66
Clearly RealMadrid 378m wages are a lot more than the other Spanish clubs e g Valencia 116m Athletic Bilbao 104m and Sevilla 92m In fact in 2018 19 they had the 4th highest wage bill in Europe only surpassed by Barcelona Manchester United and PSG
RealMadrid 378m wage bill is significantly lower than Barcelona s last reported figure of 501m 2018 19 accounts with the prior year gap up to 139m They are still 151m more than Atletico Madrid 227m
RealMadrid football wages rose 16m 5 from 362m to 378m despite 10 wage cut 36m in response to COVID would have been 20 if league had not restarted Total wages including 33m basketball were 411m Budgeted at 448m in 20 21 though talk of another 10 cut
Work on the 575m redevelopment of RealMadrid s Santiago Bernabéu stadium continued as planned with estimated completion date of 2023 114m investment to date Funding is in place charging 2 5 over 30 years Annual loan repayments of 29 5m start in July 2023
RealMadrid average attendance fell 25 from 60 598 to 45 662 the second highest in Spain below Barcelona 53 400 but above Atletico Madrid 42 146 All these figures were impacted by games being played without fans after La Liga was suspended in March
RealMadrid match day revenue fell 29m 20 from 145m to 116m despite 8m from Supercopa de Espana in Saudi Arabia as 6 home games were played behind closed doors In 2018 19 they had the second highest revenue in the world from this stream only below Barcelona 159m
Thanks to their fantastic record in the Champions League RealMadrid have earned a hefty 419m from European competition in the last 5 years which is 23m and 60m more than Barcelona and Atletico Madrid respectively In Europe this is only surpassed by Juventus
Worth noting the influence on Champions League money of the UEFA coefficient payment based on performances in Europe over 10 years where RealMadrid had the highest ranking in 2019 20 thanks to winning the competition 4 times in 5 years up to 2018 giving them 35m
RealMadrid earned 84m from the Champions League around the same as previous season when they were also eliminated in the last 16 Barcelona and Atletico Madrid received 104m and 95m respectively for reaching the quarter finals These figures are before any COVID rebate
RealMadrid benefited from La Liga international TV deal rising 30 in 2019 20 giving total TV rights of 2 0 bln Although still a long way behind the Premier League 3 6 bln it is comfortably ahead of the others Bundesliga 1 4 bln Serie A 1 3 bln Ligue 1 1 2 bln
Even after the changes Barcelona 153m and RealMadrid 145m still receive by far the highest TV income from La Liga s TV deal followed by Atletico Madrid 116m then a big gap to Valencia 76m and Sevilla 73m Lowest payment went to Mallorca 41m
After years of individual deals in Spain La Liga have introduced a collective deal based on 50 equal share 25 performance over last 5 years and 25 popularity 1 3 for average match day income 2 3 for number of TV viewers Gross income reduced by liabilities 7
RealMadrid broadcasting income fell 27m 11 from 258m to 231m partly due to 6 games played after June accounting close so revenue deferred to 2020 21 accounts Had 6th highest TV revenue in the world previous season a fair way below LFC 299m and Barcelona 298m
It s an arms race in shirt sponsorships and kit deals but RealMadrid s are among the very highest with Emirates and Adidas paying 70m and 110m a year respectively Emirates deal runs to 2022 while Adidas agreement has been extended to 2028 merchandising is on top
RealMadrid commercial income rose 14m 4 from 355m to 369m a record for the club In 2018 19 only surpassed by Barcelona 384m PSG 363m Bayern 357m Looking to increase revenue by bringing retail activities in house but it carries more risk in current climate
In the last edition of the Deloitte Money League based on 2018 19 accounts RealMadrid were overtaken by Barcelona partly due to the Catalans taking merchandising inhouse Madrid s revenue mix was commercial 47 broadcasting 34 and match day 19
Furthermore RealMadrid 6 42m revenue decrease in 2019 20 is one of the better results of clubs that have so far published accounts with most announcing significant reductions of over 15 MUFC 133m Juventus 88m Roma 87m THFC 78m and Inter 66m
However RealMadrid 715m revenue is still twice as much as Atletico Madrid 358m followed by Valencia 188m Sevilla 142m 2018 19 figures Put another way the combined 1 5 bln revenue of Barcelona Real Madrid is almost as much as the other La Liga clubs combined
In fairness Barcelona s 2019 20 revenue has dropped by 80m from 841m to 761m which is almost twice as much as RealMadrid 42m decrease to 715m That said the Catalans revenue is still 46m higher than Madrid
This means that COVID will have cost RealMadrid nearly 400m in lost revenue over two seasons 106m in 2019 20 and 283m in 2020 21 Before the pandemic the club expected revenue to grow to 900m this season but they currently budget almost 300m less
RealMadrid revenue decrease in 2019 20 from 757m to 715m follows a marginal increase from 751m the previous season Nevertheless revenue has still grown by 95m 15 in the last 4 years However the 2020 21 budget anticipates a further fall to 617m
At an operating level i e excluding player sales and interest RealMadrid loss more than doubled from 44m to 101m Profit was as high as 38m in 2016 In fairness most clubs run an operating loss as seen in 2018 19 when Madrid were mid table in the Money League
RealMadrid EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation a proxy for cash profit fell from 124m to 50m Including player sales this dropped from 223m to 151m Note the club s figure of 177m includes 26m release of impairment provision
Like many other clubs RealMadrid have become more reliant on player sales with average profits nearly tripling in last 2 years to 100m The 2020 21 budget includes 88m which has already been achieved via summer sales including Hakimi to Inter and Reguilon to Spurs
RealMadrid are normally highly profitable due to their ability to generate revenue In the 9 years before 2019 20 they accumulated an impressive 397m profit averaging 44m a season However they have budgeted a 91m loss for 2020 21 70m after tax due to COVID
RealMadrid did benefit from profit on player sales rising from 99m to 101m probably Kovacic to CFC Llorente to Atleti De Tomas to Benfica Hernandez to Milan and Navas to PSG Only surpassed in Spain by Atleti s 136m mainly Griezmann just ahead of Barcelona 95m
COVID reduced RealMadrid 19 20 revenue by 106m 13 Excluding this impact revenue would have grown 8 from 757m in 18 19 to 821m Partly offset by 70m cost savings revenue related 16m 10 wages cut 36m other 18m Made 3 5m donation for medical supplies
Clearly COVID has had a major adverse impact on finances in 2019 20 with many leading clubs across Europe reporting horrific losses e g Roma 204m Milan 195m Everton 158m Inter 100m Juventus 90m and Tottenham 72m so RealMadrid breaking even is pretty good
Even though RealMadrid post tax profit fell significantly in 2019 20 to just 313k this was still a decent result given the pandemic impact In contrast their main rivals Barcelona posted a huge 97m loss Worth noting Madrid s figures include 26m loss from basketball
Despite the revenue reduction RealMadrid wages rose 17m 4 from 394m to 411m split football 378m and basketball 33m and there were increases in player amortisation up 55m 53 from 104m to 159m and other expenses up 15m 6 to 254m
Most RealMadrid revenue streams fell membership fees stadium revenue down 47m 27 to 126m TV down 24m 14 to 149m and international competitions friendlies down 8m 7 to 116m Growth in marketing up 17m 6 to 312m and Other up 20m to 22m
RealMadrid profit before tax fell from 53m to 2m after tax down from 38m to 313k as revenue dropped 42m 6 from 757m to 715m while expenses rose 84m and profit on player sales was up 3m to 101m Profit boosted by 72m swing in impairment provision
RealMadrid 2019 20 accounts cover a season when they won La Liga were quarter finalists in the Copa del Rey won the Supercopa de Espana and exited the Champions League in the last 16 Finances impacted by COVID 19 in the last 3 months Some thoughts in the following thread
There you go Mikel Great to see an Arsenal team
I m absolutely stuffed Cheese and biscuits Fill her up Jacko
Merry Christmas everyone Today I will be
Reminder of today s thread covering Millwall s financial results for the 2019 20 season when lower player sales COVID and no repeat of previous year s FA Cup run saw their loss widen from 0 7m to 10 9m Millwall millwallFC
And here s a 2 page executive summary of Millwall s 2019 20 financials if a detailed thread is not your thing Millwall MillwallFC
Thread covering Millwall s financial results for the 2019 20 season when lower player sales COVID and no repeat of previous year s FA Cup run saw their loss widen from 0 7m to 10 9m Millwall millwallFC
Millwall have punched above their weight in the Championship though Berylson will have to continue funding to cover the operating losses Kavanagh noted Although the club is in a stronger position versus some of its peers it is not immune to COVID financial challenges
Under FFP Millwall are allowed to incur 39m losses over the 3 year monitoring period though they can make deductions for academy community and infrastructure The club is well within this limit even after the larger loss for the 2019 20 season
The good news for the club is that an agreement has finally been reached with Lewisham council with the threat of Compulsory Purchase Orders being removed so that it now looks like Millwall s scheme to transform the area around the stadium can go ahead
Millwall s best opportunity to generate more revenue is by developing the land adjoining the stadium They have a regeneration plan to create affordable housing student accommodation retail and office space a hotel and conference centre plus a stadium expansion
The owners 53m funding since 2011 has been almost entirely used to cover the club s losses of 48m over this period In contrast very little money has been spent on infrastructure investment 2 4m and player purchases less than 3m net of sales
As a result Millwall cash balance was unchanged at 0 6m one of the lowest in the Championship In fairness 15 clubs in this division had less than 2m cash in the bank so this was not exceptional though not a great buffer in the current climate
Millwall cash flow statement reveals the extent of the support of Berylson and other directors with 53m of funding provided in the last 10 years through 36m of share capital and 17m of loans including 8m of shares in 2019 20 that covered the net cash outflow
Although debt is high in the Championship most of it is provided by owners who charge little or no interest Millwall chairman John Berylson s company CHV charges 12 per annum on the loan notes but interest payments have been frequently suspended latest to June 2021
Millwall 10m gross debt is very small compared to many other clubs in the Championship who have much larger debts e g BRFC 142m and Stoke City 141m The debt at these clubs is normally not an issue so long as the owners continue to provide support
Millwall gross debt was unchanged at 9 7m of loan notes where repayment has been extended again to July 2022 This would be around 30m higher without the owners Chestnut Hill Ventures CHV effectively writing off debt by waiving interest and converting loans into equity
Millwall s player trading objective in most seasons seems to be to balance the books Even though they increased gross spend in last 2 seasons this was matched by higher sales so have still ended up essentially break even Number of senior players low compared to other clubs
Millwall player purchases of 2 8m was slightly higher than prior years 2 6m This investment has increased 4 years in a row but this was still miles below Stoke City 67m AVFC 31m and NFFC 23m Included Connor Mahoney from AFCB and Jón Daði Böðvarsson from Reading
To further emphasise Millwall s conservative approach in the transfer market their 2 2m player amortisation is the second lowest in the Championship only ahead of Rotherham United and a lot lower than big spending Stoke City 29m and Swansea City 28m
Millwall player amortisation the charge to writing off transfer fees over a player s contract rose 0 9m 71 from 1 3m to 2 2m However this is still very low highlighting the club philosophy of giving home grown players from the academy opportunities in the first team
Millwall directors remuneration was unchanged at 312k but this was still significantly lower than the likes of Reading 1 5m WBA 953k Birmingham City 932k and Nottingham Forest 932k
Millwall wages to turnover ratio increased from 92 to 115 which is not great but this is pretty much the norm in this ultra competitive division where 16 clubs are above 100 much worse than UEFA s recommended 70 upper limit
However despite the investment Millwall 18 9m wage bill continues not to match the level of salary costs of many clubs in the league Kavanagh again In particular it is much lower than clubs benefiting from parachute payments e g AVFC 83m and Stoke City 56m
Millwall wage bill rose by 2 0m 12 from 16 9m to 18 9m reflecting investment into the playing squad plus the change in manager during the season Wages have now more than doubled since promotion from 9 4m in League One in 2017
Millwall had a couple of new shirt sponsors in 2019 20 front Huski Chocolate five year agreement is the biggest in the club s history back The Energy Check for 3 years The kit supplier has been Macron from 2018
Despite the challenges of the pandemic Millwall commercial income of 2 7m remained the same However this is still one of the lowest in the Championship miles below the likes of Leeds United 27m Aston Villa 18m and Bristol City 16m
Millwall attendance fell from 13 635 to 10 748 due to 5 games behind closed doors For games played with fans attendance rose slightly to 13 734 Whichever way you look at it this is one of the lowest in the Championship only above Hull City Brentford Wigan and Luton Town
Millwall match day income fell 1 2m 23 from 5 6m to 4 4m largely due to playing 5 home games behind closed doors because of the pandemic though also no FA Cup run This was firmly in the bottom half of the Championship
Millwall broadcasting income fell by 0 6m 7 to 9 4m due to COVID impact and FA Cup money in previous year Boosted by 5 games shown live on Sky Most Championship clubs earn 8 9m from TV but there is a big gap to clubs with parachute payments
If parachute payments were excluded Millwall 16m would still be firmly in the bottom half of the Championship though the gap to LUFC 49m and AVFC 43m figures from 2018 19 season would be only around 27m
As Millwall chief executive Steve Kavanagh said The quality and wealth of many of the clubs playing in the Championship continued to rise with an increasing number of clubs in receipt of parachute payments from the Premier League led by Stoke Swansea WBA all with 43m
Even after the growth Millwall 16m revenue is still one of the smallest in the Championship though it was just above Hull City the only other club ton have published 2019 20 accounts to date Less than a quarter of WBA 71m Stoke City 71m and Swansea City 68m
Despite the revenue fall in 2019 20 from 18 4m to 16 4m Millwall revenue has still grown by 0 8m 5 from the 15 6m in the first season back in the Championship in 2017 18 mainly due to TV money However will fall further this season due to ongoing COVID restrictions
However Millwall 10m operating loss was still the second best performance in the Championship a division where most clubs operate at a significant loss due to very high wages to turnover ratios as they compete for promotion to the promised land of the Premier League
Millwall operating loss excluding player sales and interest payable widened from 5 6m to 10 2m as revenue fell but expenses increased This is the club s worst financial performance since 2015
Millwall have rarely made big money from player sales In fact they have only twice in the last 10 years generated a profit above 0 5m from this activity Saville to Boro in 2019 5 4m and Steve Morison to NCFC in 2011 1 7m
Millwall have lost 67m in the last 10 years Their losses had been falling from 12m in 2015 to just 1m in 2019 However this season s figure was adversely affected by lower player sales higher wages and no cup run worth 2 2m in 2018 19
Furthermore Millwall bottom line received almost no benefit from player sales just 76k profit a steep decline compared to prior season 5 4m which included the lucrative move of George Saville to Boro Miles behind Bristol City s amazing 38m profit from this activity
Excluding these property sales only 5 Championship clubs were profitable in 2018 19 with 11m highest profits at Bristol City and Brentford On this basis Millwall 11m loss was actually 11th best in the division not bad for a team that finished just outside the play offs
It is also worth noting that some clubs figures were boosted by once off accounting profits from the sale of stadiums training grounds and land especially DCFC 40m SWFC 38m and AVFC 36m so their underlying figures were even worse than reported
Despite the deterioration Millwall loss of 10 9m is still only mid table in the Championship This result is likely to look better when other clubs publish their COVID impacted 2019 20 accounts In fact before the pandemic no fewer than 6 clubs posted losses above 20m
Millwall wage bill rose 2 0m 12 from 16 9m to 18 9m while player amortisation increased 0 9m 71 to 2 2m and depreciation was up 0 2m 49 to 0 7m The reduction in activities due to the pandemic meant other expenses fell 1 0m 15 to 5 8m
Millwall revenue decrease was largely driven by match day falling 1 3m 23 to 4 4m as 5 games were played behind closed doors while broadcasting decreased 0 7m 7 to 9 4m Commercial income held steady at 2 7m
Millwall pre tax loss widened from 0 7m to 10 9m largely due to profit on player sales dropping 5 3m to 0 1m though COVID and a run to FA Cup quarter final prior year meant revenue fell 2 0m 11 from 18 4m to 16 4m while expenses rose 2 3m 9
Millwall 2019 20 financial results covered a season when they improved their position in the Championship from 21st to 8th Manager Neil Harris left in October 2019 replaced by Gary Rowett COVID 19 had a substantial impact on the club s operations Some thoughts follow
I genuinely feel sorry for Runarsson He s clearly not good enough so should not have been exposed like that The more important question is how on earth anyone could have sanctioned his purchase when everyone and I mean everyone said he wasn t up to it
What can you say about Mustafi He s half asleep all the time
In response to another request here s the combined transfer spend gross and net for the Premier League and the Championship for the 5 years up until 2018 19 season
Transfer spend is likely to fall due to the deflationary impact of COVID on prices but the 2019 20 figures will still be on the high side as these cover transfer windows that took place before the pandemic struck i e summer 2019 and January 2020
Cash flow includes stage payments for prior year transfers In our AFC example the higher figure for purchases reflects the 23m decrease in transfer payables while the higher figure for sales is due to 38m reduction in transfer receivables
These numbers are different from other transfer figures e g purchases and sales in club s cash flow statement or those widely reported on the Transfermarkt website For example AFC net spend in 2018 19 is 81m on balance sheet 62m in cash flow and 65m in Transfermarkt
As a technical note these figures have been taken from the balance sheet in the club accounts The calculation for player sales here is net book value plus profit on player sales value equals cost less amortisation for disposals Includes agents fees
Of the current Championship clubs Swans have by far the highest sales in last 5 years with 199m followed by NCFC 118m Boro 110m WatfordFC 91m and SCFC 78m The next highest is BrentfordFC with a noteworthy 76m
Gross transfer spend is similar with the highest at AFCB and WatfordFC both 242m followed by SCFC 221m though Swans were next with 191m Note DCFC and SWFC have not yet published accounts for 2018 19 so their figures only cover 4 years
Highest net spend in the Championship predictably from clubs that were recently in the top flight AFCB 211m WatfordFC 151m SCFC 142m HTAFC 85m and Boro 65m Almost half of the clubs reported net sales led by BrentfordFC 35m
It is worth appreciating that profit on player sales can be very different from the value of the transfer As one example MUFC shifted 280m of players in the 5 years up to 2018 19 the 3rd highest in the Premier League but their profit was only 69m 13th highest in the PL
Highest transfer sales were CFC 450m in line with their business model followed by LFC 394m and MUFC 280m Next highest came SaintsFC with an impressive 256m which is in stark contrast to their South Coast peers BHAFC only 24m
The picture is a bit different for gross transfer spend in the Premier League MCFC still lead the way with 892m just ahead of CFC 890m and MUFC 870m Next highest are the two Liverpool clubs LFC 731m and EFC 533m followed by AFC 528m
It is striking how low THFC net spend was only 63m in the 5 years up to 2018 19 though worth noting that they then splashed out 136m in 2019 20 Lowest spend unsurprisingly at clubs recently promoted from the Championship i e LUFC 4m and SUFC 13 m
In terms of the infamous net spend the two Manchester clubs have spent most on transfers MCFC 639m and MUFC 590m followed by CFC 440m AFC fans will be appalled to discover they have spent around the same 329m as champions LFC 337m
I had a request to look at transfer spend in the Premier League so I have analysed this over the last 5 years up to 2018 19 the last season when all clubs have published their accounts As a Christmas bonus I have also included the EFL Championship

Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on Everton s 2019 20 financial results when their COVID impacted loss widened to 140m the third highest ever in the Premier League Farhad Moshiri has provided 400m of funding to date EFC
And for those Everton fans who would prefer a more concise view of their financials here s the 2 page executive summary of the 2019 20 results EFC
Thread on Everton s 2019 20 financial results when their COVID impacted loss widened to 140m the third highest ever in the Premier League Farhad Moshiri has provided 400m of funding to date EFC
As EFC said we remain in a secure financial position thanks to the unwavering support of our majority shareholder That said even with the COVID impact the losses are striking It remains to be seen whether the significant investment delivers success and sustainability
EFC hefty losses have raised concerns over ability to meet Premier League Profitability and Sustainability rules though they are probably closer than most might think after adjusting for depreciation women s football youth community plus stadium costs and COVID impact
As an example of Moshiri s commitment to EFC in the Premier League only Chelsea s owner Roman Abramovich had provided more funding in the 5 years up to 2019 440m vs 300m and the British Iranian businessman has added 100m since then
Since these accounts were finalised the owner has added another 50m loan which means he has provided 400m of funding to EFC since his arrival In addition the club will issue 250m shares to Moshiri including the conversion of some of his loans to equity
In the last 4 years EFC available cash of 366m was almost entirely provided by 348m of loans from Moshiri The vast majority of this 253m has been used to improve the squad while 33m went on capex and 19m interest payments with 59m increase in cash balance
As a result EFC cash balance increased by 29m from 27m to 56m the club s highest for many years This is actually the 4th highest in the Premier League though it should be noted that there is a 40m short term liability to pay for social security and other taxes
EFC generated 11m cash from operating activities though this was driven by 57m increase in creditors Then spent 43m net on players 8m infrastructure and 3m interest leading to 42m cash deficit Funded by 50m additional loan from Moshiri and 21m other loans
EFC paid 3 1m interest on their loans up from prior year 1 7m though much lower than MUFC 20m The fact that Moshiri s loans are interest free is a big plus but interest payments will increase due to funding for new stadium see THFC 14m and AFC 11m
If the Moshiri loan is considered as debt EFC 409m is the 3rd largest in England only below THFC 831m and MUFC 526m Club also has 54m contingent liabilities based on things like number of appearances plus 35m possible signing on fees loyalty bonuses
Per EFC gross debt rose from 37m to 59m loans from Rights and Media Funding 40m and Metro Bank 19m In addition Everton classify 350m interest free loan provided by owner Moshiri as equity as no agreed repayment date but other clubs treat such friendly loans as debt
Since Moshiri s arrival EFC have been far more active in the transfer market In the last 4 seasons they averaged 142m gross spend up from 24m average in the preceding 6 seasons Over the same period net spend has increased from 8m to 73m
EFC made 113m player purchases including Moise Kean Alex Iwobi Fabian Delph and Jean Philippe Gbamin taking their expenditure in the past 4 years to an amazing 566m thanks to Moshiri providing funds to support the squad improvements Further 70m spent since year end
EFC other operating costs fell 10m 23 from 43m to 33m partly due to continued tight management of operational costs but also because prior year included an additional month after the change in year end
EFC player amortisation the annual charge to expense transfer fees over the length of a player s contract rose 4m 4 from 95m to 99m This has more than quadrupled in 4 years up from only 22m in 2016 and is now above both AFC 90m and THFC 75m
EFC directors remuneration decreased from 3 6m to 3 5m though the highest paid director rose 311k 34 from 927k to 1 238k This was mid table in the Premier League far below the likes of Ed Woodward at MUFC and Daniel Levy at THFC both around 3m
EFC reported wages to turnover ratio increased from 85 to 89 partly due to COVID impacted revenue This is the highest worst in the Premier League even if we adjust for outsourced catering retail revenue which would reduce the ratio to 86
Following this growth EFC 165m wage bill is currently 7th highest in the Premier League around 16m below THFC Despite the rise it s still only around half of MCFC 315m and LFC 310m though these may drop when 2019 20 accounts are published
EFC wage bill rose 5m 3 to 165m though the underlying growth is 17m 12 as prior year accounts included 13 months This means that wages have virtually doubled in just 4 years from 84m in 2016 In the same period revenue has only grown by 53
EFC hope to start work on new 52 000 capacity stadium at Bramley Moore Dock in 2021 if planning permission granted Estimated cost is 500m but could be a game changer as seen by THFC match day income rising to 95m even in COVID impacted season with their new stadium
As 5 games played behind closed doors EFC average attendance fell from 39 043 to 28 848 though rose to 39 103 for games with fans in attendance 9th highest in Premier League Some of cheapest prices in top flight most expensive season ticket less than 30 a match
EFC gate receipts fell 2m 16 from 14m to 12m due to 5 games played behind closed doors and 1 Cup game less This is very low compared to the elite clubs e g LFC earn around 7 times as much 84m while Everton are even below likes of BHAFC and CPFC
EFC CEO Denise Barrett Baxendale said It is encouraging that our commercial performance has improved markedly and this will continue to be a priority moving forward Indeed it now represents 41 of total revenue one of the highest in the Premier League
From 2020 21 EFC have two new 3 year sponsorships Cazoo have replaced SportPesa shirt for similar amount 10m a year while Hummel will pay 10m for kit deal replacing Umbro 6m Also include 12m USM training ground naming rights deal
Thanks to that option EFC growth in commercial income since 2016 compares favourably with the Big Six and is highest in percentage terms Although the gap has narrowed Everton 76m is still a long way below the likes of MUFC 279m MCFC 227m and LFC 188m
Note EFC innovative deal where USM paid for option to buy naming rights for new stadium is not for the actual naming rights but just an option for first refusal The Premier League will review agreement to check it is in line with FFP
EFC commercial revenue increased by 35m 86 from 41m to 76m comprising sponsorship advertising merchandising 64m and other commercial 12m though this does include once off 30m payment from USM for stadium naming rights option
EFC strategy is to spend big in the hope of securing regular European football worth 60 90m in 2020 for Champions League entrants and 17 25m for the Europa League Everton have earned 14m from Europe in last 5 years compared to MCFC 390m LFC 310m and THFC 299m
EFC Premier League TV money fell 28m from 124m to 96m though 22m revenue has been deferred into 2020 21 accounts as 2019 20 season extended beyond June However next season will also include a 9m rebate to broadcasters for the same reason
TV money has driven EFC revenue growth in recent years but plunged 35m 26 from 133m to 98m due to revenue from 7 games slipping to 2020 21 accounts plus rebate to broadcasters and lower Premier League finishing position One of lowest in PL but others will also fall
Based on 2018 19 revenue EFC dropped two places from 17th to 19th in the Deloitte Money League which ranks clubs globally by revenue Their 188m was higher than the likes of Napoli 183m Milan 182m Ajax 176m and Benfica 174m
More positively EFC small 2m revenue decrease in 2019 20 is one of the better results of clubs that have so far published accounts with many announcing significant reductions MUFC 118m Barcelona 102m Juventus 77m Roma 77m and THFC 69m
Despite EFC revenue growth there remains a huge disparity with the Big Six where the lowest revenue THFC 392m is more than twice as much In fact all of the leading clubs revenue growth in the last four years is higher than Everton except MUFC and AFC
EFC 186m revenue has grown 64m 53 from 122m in 2016 Vast majority of the growth has come from commercial 55m though TV revenue also up 15m despite 2019 20 deferrals and rebates Note if outsourced catering retail were included revenue would be 6m higher at 192m
At an operating level i e excluding player sales and interest EFC loss increased from 127m to 175m Very few Premier League clubs post operating profits but Everton s loss is currently the highest this season and only surpassed by MCFC 2011 195m in PL history
EFC EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered a proxy for cash operating profit as it strips out player sales and exceptional items improved slightly from 15 m to 12 m though this was still the worst in the Premier League
In fact only CFC and LFC made more money from player sales than EFC 168m in the four years up to 2019 though Everton did better than THFC AFC MCFC and MUFC They will need to adopt this as a key part of their business model to achieve sustainability in the short term
On the other hand EFC have increasingly relied on profit from player sales which has averaged an impressive 50m a season over the last 4 years compared to just 13m in the preceding 6 years
EFC figures hit by 115m exceptional costs in last 5 seasons including 32m payments for management changes 6 5m for Marco Silva and 37m player impairment 26m in 2020 Also 39m new stadium costs 20m in 2020 which can be capitalised once planning permission granted
EFC have reported losses 5 times in the last 6 seasons with the sole exception being 31m profit in 2017 That includes growing losses in each of the last 3 seasons with a total deficit over this period of 265m
EFC loss would have been even higher without 40m profit from player sales 20m higher than prior year Included Idrissa Gueye to PSG Ademola Lookman to RB Leipzig Nikola Vlasic to CSKA Moscow and Henry Onyekuru to Monaco One of highest profits from this activity in the PL
Furthermore the pandemic has obviously significantly impacted finances in 2019 20 with many leading clubs posting horrific losses e g Roma 184m Milan 175m Inter 92m Barcelona 87m and Juventus 81m so EFC are not alone
That said EFC 140m loss is actually the 3rd worst ever posted in the Premier League while previous year s 112m is 5th largest The Everton board would argue that these results reflect the club s position in the early stages of a long term investment cycle
EFC 140m loss is the highest reported to date in the 2019 20 Premier League though all clubs are likely to report worse numbers last season e g THFC swung from 87m profit tax to 68m loss while MUFC went from 27m profit to 21m loss
EFC had been on course to report record revenue of 220m prior to the pandemic so lost revenue some deferred into 2020 21 accounts was 33m Adding 34m impairment as player values hit by slump in transfer market meant 67m total COVID impact so underlying loss was 73m
As a technical point it s worth noting that EFC changed their accounting close date from May 31st to June 30th in 2018 19 so prior year covered a 13 month period with little impact on turnover but an additional month of expenses which adversely impacted the bottom line
Following further investment in the squad EFC wage bill increased 5m 3 to 165m and player amortisation rose 4m 4 to 99m but other expenses were cut 10m 23 to 33m On the other hand exceptional items and player impairment were up 23m and 24m respectively
EFC broadcasting income dropped 35m 26 from 133m to 98m while gate receipts fell 2m 16 from 14m to 12m mainly due to the delayed conclusion to the season However this was largely offset by commercial rising 35m 86 from 41m to 76m
EFC loss widened from 112m to a club record 140m mainly due to 57m of exceptional charges including impairment up 47m from prior year Revenue fell 2m 1 to 186m but profit on player sales doubled from 20m to 40m Overall operating expenses were flat
Everton s 2019 20 financial results covered a very challenging season when they finished 12th in the Premier League Carlo Ancelotti replaced Marco Silva as manager in December 2019 Adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic Some thoughts in the following thread EFC

Final call for today s thread on Napoli s 2019 20 financial results where they swung from 48m pre tax profit to 20m loss though this was much smaller than other leading Italian clubs SSCNapoli
And here s the two pager executive summary of Napoli s 2019 20 financials SSCNapoli
Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on Napoli s 2019 20 financial results where they swung from 48m pre tax profit to 20m loss though this was much smaller than other leading Italian clubs SSCNapoli
And for those who prefer a more concise overview here s the two pager of Napoli s 2019 20 financials SSCNapoli
As my own small tribute to the late great Diego Maradona here s a review of Napoli s 2019 20 financial results where they swung from 48m pre tax profit to 20m loss though much lower than other leading Italian clubs SSCNapoli
SSCNapoli 2019 2 result was clearly impacted by COVID but the loss was relatively small compared to Italian peers However their business model is reliant on Champions League qualification boosted by lucrative player sales so it would be no surprise to see Koulibaly depart
Thanks to their sustainable approach over many years SSCNapoli had an incredible 124m cash balance which is well over twice as much as the nearest Italian club Inter 55m Excluding these two the other 18 Serie A clubs combined only have 119m i e less than Napoli
However SSCNapoli transfer fees debt increased from 113m to 143m though they are themselves owed 109m by other clubs so the net payable is only 34m the lowest for 5 years The gross transfer debt is 3rd highest in Italy only behind Juventus 301m and Roma 191m
As a consequence SSCNapoli paid no interest in 2019 20 which provides a major competitive advantage against the likes of Roma 32m Inter 26m and Juventus 15m This is testament to the club s ability to fund itself from its own operations
The absence of bank debt at SSCNapoli is in stark contrast to clubs like Inter 461m Goldman Sachs financing Juventus 396m mainly for new stadium and Roma 318m mainly bond issue
SSCNapoli have had zero financial debt for the last four years and only had a 4m shareholder loan before that De Laurentiis observed In Italy there are two or three clubs with balanced books and I m the only one who doesn t have any bank debt
It s a similar story in gross spend with SSCNapoli 409m being 5th highest in Italy though 350m less than Juventus 758m Also behind Inter 525m Milan 515m and Roma 429m One interesting comparative is high flying Atalanta who are around half as much with 216m
Over the last 4 seasons SSCNapoli have the 4th highest net spend in Serie A of 124m only surpassed by Milan 287m Inter 207m and Juventus 204m Half of the clubs have had net sales including Sampdoria 61m and Roma 27m
SSCNapoli have significantly increased gross transfer spend averaging 102m in last 4 years but sales have also increased to 71m which means that they averaged 31m net spend 2019 20 player purchases included Lozano Lobotka Petagna Elmas Rrahmani and Demme
As a result SSCNapoli player amortisation of 118m is the third highest in Italy though a long way below Juventus 167m but very close to Inter 120m Maybe surprisingly they are ahead of big spending Milan 95m and Roma 94m
Following investment in the squad SSCNapoli player amortisation the annual cost of writing off transfer fees increased by 36m 45 from 82m to 118m which means that this expense has grown by an incredible 68m from 50m in 2016 i e more than doubling in that time
Following the 2020 increase from 62 to 79 ASRoma wages to turnover ratio is 6th highest worst in Italy higher than Juventus 70 Inter 64 and especially Atalanta 49 but better than Roma 104 and Milan 93 Above UEFA s recommended upper limit of 70
Despite the increase SSCNapoli wage bill of 141m is still 5th highest in Italy less than half of Juventus 284m and a fair way below Inter 198m Within striking distance of Milan 161m and Roma 155m Worth noting over twice as much as Atalanta 69m the next highest
In fact since 2016 SSCNapoli wages growth of 56m has only been outpaced by Inter 74m and Juventus 63m Over the same period Roma wage bill was flat while Milan actually dropped 3m In percentage terms only Atalanta s growth was better than Napoli
ASRoma wage bill rose 6m 4 from 135m to 141m as player salaries increased 10m while coaching staff fell 4m and bonuses were down 1m Wages up 56m in the last 4 years while revenue only rose 35m increasing wages to turnover from 59 to 79
ASRoma player loans income fell 8m from 11m to 3m mainly Adam Ounas to Nice Leading the way in Italy are Inter 9m Milan 8m Roma 7m and Atalanta 7m
SSCNapoli commercial income has hardly grown in the last decade leading to a massive disparity with other leading European clubs Even before last season s decrease their 46m in 2018 19 was miles below the likes of Barcelona 384m PSG 363m Bayern 357m MUFC 355m
SSCNapoli long standing shirt sponsor since 2015 is mineral water Lete worth 9m a year while kit supplier Kappa have extended their 8m a year deal until 2022 Also secondary sponsor MSC and back of shirt Kimbo Long way behind Juventus 93m Jeep 42m and Adidas 51m
SSCNapoli commercial income fell 5m 11 from 47m to 42m as sponsorship dropped 10m from 37m to 27m partly because of COVID deferring revenue to 2021 Now 4th highest in Serie A though much lower than Juventus 186m Inter 142m and Milan 68m
SSCNapoli have a project to redevelop their stadium described as an ever increasing toilet by the colourful president De Laurentiis Recently renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona to honour their former star Lowest match day revenue of top 20 European clubs
SSCNapoli average attendance decreased from 29 000 to 21 490 again due to 7 games being played behind closed doors This remained the 7th highest in Italy a long way below Inter 41 558 Milan 34 078 and Juventus 28 263 who all saw similar falls to Napoli
SSCNapoli match day income fell 3m 17 from 16m to 13m split domestic 7m down 2m Europe 6m down 1m the 3rd year in a row it has decreased Impacted by playing 7 home games behind closed doors due to COVID 6th highest in Italy far below Juventus 49m
The Champions League is extremely important for SSCNapoli who have earned an impressive 246m from Europe in last 5 seasons only surpassed in Italy by Juventus 449m and Roma 255m but ahead of Inter 117m Lazio 76m Atalanta 71m and Milan 29m
SSCNapoli earned estimated 70m for reaching the Champions League last 16 higher than prior season s 57m Champions League group Europa League quarter final Other Italian clubs Juventus 87m Atalanta 58m and Inter 57m These figures are before any COVID rebate
It is imperative that SSCNapoli do well in Europe to boost their broadcasting income as the TV rights in Serie A are relatively low Indeed there were big increases in England and Spain in 2019 20 and France in 2020 21 while Italy was unchanged
In 2018 19 SSCNapoli received 77m TV money from Serie A 50 equal share 30 performance 15 last season 10 last 5 years 5 historical and 20 supporters However 2019 20 revenue was 27m lower as some income deferred to 2020 21 as games played in July and August
SSCNapoli broadcasting income fell 22m 15 from 143m to 121m mainly due to domestic TV dropping 27m 31 from 87m to 60m partly offset by UEFA prize money increasing 5m 9 from 56m to 61m Second highest in Italy though a long way below Juventus 166m
According to the Deloitte Money League SSCNapoli had the 20th highest revenue in the world in 2018 19 with 207m up from 21st the prior year This is around the same level as Everton 213m but ahead of clubs like Ajax 199m Benfica 198m and Valencia 185m
Due to COVID most clubs revenue has fallen dramatically in 2020 so SSCNapoli 31m reduction excluding player loans is actually better than Roma 90m Inter 63m Juventus 58m Milan 42m Atalanta and Fiorentina accounts closed in December i e before the pandemic
Nevertheless SSCNapoli 179m revenue is now 3rd highest in Italy though less than half of Juventus 407m and 132m below Inter That said they have overtaken both Milan 172m and Roma 149m Revenue mix TV 68 commercial 23 match day 8 and player loans 1
SSCNapoli revenue growth highlights importance of the Champions League as 2020 revenue of 179m was greatly boosted by 67m from this tournament In fact excluding European money revenue has actually dropped by 19m 14 since 2016 whereas it is up 35m 24 in total
Similarly SSCNapoli operating loss excluding profit on player sales interest widened from 35m to 116m down from 4m only 3 years ago Again this is much better than the traditional Big 4 operating losses Juventus 234m Milan 202m Roma 195m and Inter 133m
SSCNapoli EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered a proxy for underlying profitability as it excludes once off items like player sales and exceptional items fell from 49m to 4m though still one of the best in Italy
In fact SSCNapoli 325m profit from player sales in last 5 years is only beaten by Juventus 563m and Roma 372m but is 100m more than the next highest Inter 226m Three largest profits ever Higuain to Juventus 86m Cavani to PSG 64m and Jorginho to CFC 60m
Player sales are very important for SSCNapoli increasingly so as they have averaged 65m a season in the last 5 years compared to only 24m in previous 5 The club needs to periodically sell stars to balance the books This season will include the sale of Allan to Everton
SSCNapoli have posted 4 losses in the last 6 years though have accumulated an impressive 196m profits over the last decade including two hefty profits in 2017 101m and 2019 48m Unless the COVID situation improves club is likely to report a substantial loss in 2021
SSCNapoli benefited from 96m profit on player sales Diawara to Roma 19m Inglese to Parma 17m Rog to Cagliari 15m Verdi to Torino 11m Vinicius to Benfica 11m Up on prior year 83m Jorginho 60m and Hamsik 20m 2nd highest in Italy behind Juventus 167m
COVID has reduced SSCNapoli revenue in 2019 20 by an estimated 32m broadcasting 23m sponsorship 7m and match day 2m Without this loss Napoli would have reported 306m total revenue including 96m from player sales i e higher than prior year s 300m
SSCNapoli post tax 19m loss is not great but it is much lower than huge 2019 20 losses at other Italian clubs impacted by COVID e g Roma 204m Milan 195m Inter 102m and Juventus 90m Note some clubs have 31 December year end so accounts do not reflect pandemic
The main drivers of SSCNapoli expenses increase were player amortisation which rose 36m 45 from 82m to 118m and wages up 6m 4 from 135m to 141m Other expenses were also 2m 5 higher at 34m though depreciation fell 1m to 2m
All SSCNapoli revenue streams were lower with broadcasting being the largest reduction down 22m 15 to 121m though there were also falls in commercial down 5m 11 to 42m and match day down 3m 17 to 13m Player loans decreased 8m to 3m
SSCNapoli swung from 48m pre tax profit to 20m loss a 68m deterioration as revenue fell 38m 17 from 217m to 179m and expenses rose 43m 17 to 295m partly offset by 13m increase in profit on player sales to 96m After tax 29m profit to 19m loss
SSCNapoli 2019 20 accounts cover a season when they finished 7th in Serie A but won the Coppa Italia and reached last 16 of the Champions League Manager Carlo Ancelotti replaced by Gennaro Gattuso in December Impacted by COVID 19 in the last 3 months Some thoughts follow
Hearts pre tax profit fell from 2 9m to 0 4m in 2019 20 as COVID led to revenue dropping 2 7m 18 from 15 1m to 12 4m and wage bill rose 0 6m to 8 8m Profit due to 3 7m of donations up from 3 4m prior year Debt rose 1 3m to 5 7m but cash also up to 2 4m HMFC
AZ had second highest pre tax profit in Netherlands of 8m despite profit on player sales falling from 24m to 13m Revenue up 21 to 31m after reaching Europa League last 32 Wages increased 12 to 22m Included 10m insurance payment for damaged stand roof
Feyenoord revenue up 4 to 73m thanks to reaching Europa League group stage However pre tax loss slightly worse at 9m highest in the Eredivisie as profit from player sales fell from 8m to 4m Wages up 3m to 38m but 51 wages to turnover ratio lowest in league
PSV revenue fell 25m 26 from 97m to 72m as they competed in Europa League rather than Champions League in prior season As a result operating loss widened to 41m but pre tax profit only fell from 6m to 2m due to profit from player sales rising 26m to 47m
Ajax pre tax profit fell 42m from 69m to 27m mainly due to revenue dropping 37m 19 from record 199m to 162m and expenses increasing by 17m partly offset by profit on player sales rising 12m to 84m Debt now includes 151m financial leases due to IFRS 16
I ve had a couple of requests to update the two page executive summary for leading Dutch clubs so this thread includes 2019 20 financial overviews for Ajax PSV Feyenoord and AZ Note the Dutch season ended early in April due to COVID 19
Final call for today s thread on RangersFC financial results for 2019 20 when their pre tax loss widened from 11 4m to 17 8m despite revenue rising 11 to 59m as investment in the squad led to wages growing 26 to 43m and debt up to 19m
Lunchtime reminder of the one page comparison between CelticFC and RangersFC 2019 20 financial results
Lunchtime reminder of the more concise view of RangersFC 2019 20 financial results with a two page executive summary
Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on RangersFC financial results for 2019 20 when their pre tax loss widened from 11 4m to 17 8m despite revenue rising 11 to 59m as investment in the squad led to wages growing 26 to 43m and debt up to 19m
In 2019 20 Aberdeen s loss narrowed from 5 0m to 3 2m largely because prior year included 4 3m impairment of Pittodrie Revenue dropped 1 6m 10 to 14 3m due to COVID while wages rose 0 5m 6 to 9 8m Debt cut from 7 2m to 1 3m after equity conversion
Now I m off for a cup of tea
And finally a handy one page comparison between CelticFC and RangersFC 2019 20 financial results
For those who would prefer a more concise view of RangersFC 2019 20 financial results here s a two page executive summary
Thread on RangersFC financial results for 2019 20 when their pre tax loss widened from 11 4m to 17 8m despite revenue rising 11 to 59m as investment in the first team led to wages growing 26 to 43m and debt up to 19m
Under Steven Gerrard RangersFC have clearly made a lot of progress on the pitch supported by significant investment from directors This funding will have to continue until the club qualifies for the Champions League group stage or starts selling some of its talent
This led to the auditors warning of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt as to the club s ability to continue as a going concern However the directors have confirmed that they will provide financial support as required which they have done to date
RangersFC board have stated that the club will need additional debt or equity funding of 8 8m in 2020 21 and a further 14 4m in 2021 22 That would take total funding from investors up to a hefty 109m since 2013 All loans are interest free except Dave King 0 8
Since 2013 RangersFC available cash of 84m all came from investor funding a 49m from loans b 34m from issuing share capital Most of this has been used to cover operating losses 29m 22m on players net 12m capital expenditure and 7m purchase of trade assets
RangersFC basically broke even on operating activities in cash terms boosted by increase in creditors but then spent 8 1m net on new players 2 8m on infrastructure while paying 0 7m interest This was funded by net new investor loans of 21 3m increasing cash by 10m
However RangersFC have also funded their investment in new players by increasing transfer debt i e paying transfer fees in instalments from just 0 3m in 2016 to 14 3m in 2020 The club is only owed 0 3m by other clubs for player sales
As chairman Douglas Park noted RangersFC progress is underpinned by significant investment from directors and shareholders Indeed since year end they have provided further 4 5m of loans and converted 13 3m to equity 48m in 3 years leaving only 6 5m investor debt
RangersFC 19 3m gross debt is more than all the other Scottish Premiership clubs combined 16m with the next highest being Celtic 5 3m Hearts 4 3m and Dundee 1 6m However Rangers cash rose from 1 0m to 11 1m only surpassed by Celtic 22m so net debt was 8 1m
RangersFC gross debt increased from 14 5m to 19 3m comprising investor loans 15 3m other commercial loans 2 9m and lease agreements 1 0m Would have been much higher without investors converting 34m of debt into equity in last 2 seasons including 17 7m in 2019 20
As a result RangersFC have invested 41m in their squad since 2017 averaging 10m a year compared to only 4m in the preceding 4 years However they only had one year with net spend in that period 7m in 2017 Since then they have had 30m net sales in total
RangersFC spent 11m on player purchases mainly Ryan Kent and Filip Helander but only around half of Celtic s 21m Much more than other Scottish clubs e g Aberdeen 1 3m Hibernian 1 1m Hearts 0 6m Spent 15 4m since year end mainly Roofe Itten and presumably Hagi
As a rule Scottish clubs do not pay big money to sign players meaning that their player amortisation charge is normally very low In fact only the Old Firm clubs book more than 500k a year though Celtic s 12 2m is much more than RangersFC 7 6m
As a result of squad investment RangersFC player amortisation the annual cost of writing off transfer fees increased by 1 9m 34 from 5 6m to 7 6m up from only 0 8m in 2016 Also booked 0 8m impairment charge to reduce the value of certain players in the accounts
Just for a bit of fun a comparison with the Premier League shows that RangersFC 43m wage bill was lower than every club over 10m below Cardiff City 54m The English Big Six wages were 4 8 times as much MUFC 332m THFC 179m
RangersFC wages to turnover ratio increased from 65 to 73 better than Celtic 77 but worse than Aberdeen 68 All of these clubs are around UEFA s recommended upper limit of 70
Similar to revenue RangersFC have closed the wages gap to Celtic in the last 3 years from 35m in 2018 to 11m in 2020 There remains an abyss between the Old Firm and the other Scottish clubs e g the next highest are Aberdeen 10m Hearts 8m and Hibernian 6m
RangersFC wage bill grew by 8 8m 26 from 34 5m to 43 3m mainly due to a 6 7m rise in first team salaries as the board continued to invest in the team as we strive for success on the pitch This means that wages have more than tripled from 13m since promotion in 2016
So it is good news that RangersFC have signed a 5 year kit deal with Castore reportedly worth 4m a season from 2020 21 up from Hummel s 3m Shirt sponsor 32Red has extended its deal by 2 years until end of this season while back of shirt sponsor Utlita has done the same
RangersFC commercial revenue fell 0 5m 5 from 10 3m to 9 8m comprising sponsorship advertising 3 1m commercial 3 9m and other income 2 8m This is less than half of Celtic s 20 8m so there is room for improvement here
Match day revenue is hugely important for Scottish clubs given the low TV deal Per Deloitte this accounts for an incredible 48 of total revenue in Scotland with the next highest being Belgium 26 Many fans have left their money with the club after being offered refunds
RangersFC average attendance fell slightly from 49 563 to 49 238 though season tickets again sold out at 45 664 as they have done for this season even though the expectation is many games will be played behind closed doors Around 9 000 below Celtic s 57 857
RangersFC match day income rose 3 7m 12 from 32 0m to 35 7m despite 5 Premiership home games not played after season s early closure thanks to Europa League progress and 5 ticket price increase Just below Celtic 35 8m then big drop to Hearts 6 0m and Aberdeen 3 7m
It is therefore significant that recent good performances in Europe by RangersFC and Celtic have improved Scotland s UEFA coefficient meaning there s a decent chance that the 2021 22 Scottish champions will automatically qualify for the Champions League group stage
European qualification is very important for RangersFC as seen by 17m from the Europa League driving the improvement in revenue in the last 2 years However in the last 5 years Celtic have earned 98m including over 30m from the Champions League in both 2017 and 2018
Per my estimate RangersFC earned 10 1m from reaching Europa League last 16 split between starting fee 2 75m prize money 5 0m UEFA coefficient 0 9m and TV pool 1 4m This is around 3 5m more than prior season s 6 6m when they did not get out of the EL group
In total RangersFC broadcasting revenue rose 2 6m 24 from 10 9m to 13 5m with all the growth coming from the Europa League up from 6 4m to 8 9m More SPFL central funds were offset by the rebate from League finishing early so domestic TV flat at 4 6m
There is a new five year Scottish Premiership TV deal with Sky Sports worth 30m a year from 2020 21 but this is not really going to move the needle For example it s still only around half of Poland s Ekstraklasa 58m
In contrast Scottish Premiership TV deal is very low so RangersFC only received 2 4m To give this some context Premier League winners got 152m while last place was worth 97m Even a Championship club no parachute payments got twice as much 7m as Scotland s winners
Of course that comparison is a bit misleading as English clubs benefit from huge TV money For example if we compare RangersFC with West Ham the club with 7th highest revenue in England the vast majority of the 132m difference is broadcasting 123m
For some more perspective RangersFC 59m is only around half as much as the bottom club in the Premier League namely Huddersfield Town with 119m in 2018 19
This is at the heart of RangersFC issue Even if they win in Scotland they would be the proverbial big fish in a small pond In 2018 19 the SPFL generated 240m revenue miles below England 5 9 bln and Spain 3 4 bln but also behind Belgium 344m and Austria 256m
This might seem like a somewhat spurious comparison but the fact is that in 2006 RangersFC were placed as high as 18th in the Money League Since then their revenue has actually fallen by 8m while the club in 20th place has increased by 124m and the top club by 539m
However to highlight the magnitude of RangersFC challenge despite the growth their 59m revenue is still 95m below the 154m required to be in the Top 30 European clubs as shown in the Deloitte Money League Their recent Europa League opponents Benfica had 174m revenue
For RangersFC to increase their revenue by 6m 11 in a COVID impacted season is a noteworthy achievement especially considering the hefty reductions in most other leading clubs e g MUFC 118m 19 Barcelona 102m 13 Juventus 77m 18 and THFC 69m 15
The Old Firm generate significantly more revenue than other Scottish clubs For example RangersFC 59m is around four times as much as Hearts 15m and Aberdeen 14m followed by Hibernian 11m Kilmarnock 7m Motherwell 5m and St Mirren 4m
Celtic have enjoyed a substantial revenue advantage over RangersFC in recent times but the gap has considerably narrowed over the last three years from 69m in 2018 to 11m in 2020
In last 2 years RangersFC revenue has grown by impressive 81 26m from 33m to 59m with all 3 revenue streams up match day 13m 55 broadcasting 9m 209 and commercial 4m 84 However matches behind closed doors likely to mean 10m revenue loss this season
RangersFC operating loss i e excluding player sales widened from 11 6m to 15 9m in 2019 20 down from a 1 8m profit in 2012 13 This is obviously not great though fans will note that it is around 9m better than Celtic s 24 5m deficit
In stark contrast player sales have made a big difference to Celtic s bottom line In the last eight years they have generated 102m profit from player trading compared to only 6m in the same period at RangersFC
RangersFC have made very little from player sales making only 6m from this activity in the last 8 years while they received just 1m after accounts closed In future will have to sell more profitably to be sustainable Likely suspects include Morelos Kent and Barisic
RangersFC did post a small profit of 1 2m in 2012 13 but this was only due to a 20 5m release of negative goodwill Last season included 3 1m provision for the legal dispute with Sports Direct which is presumably why other expenses rose despite it being a curtailed season
RangersFC revenue was obviously affected by the curtailment of the 2019 20 season which meant that from March to June there was no football or corresponding match day revenue while retail sales conferences and other events were also hit
That said RangersFC have consistently lost money in recent times aggregating 70m of losses in the last seven years The 18m loss in 2029 20 is the largest in that period partly due to the investment in the squad but also adversely impacted by the pandemic
Indeed player trading is main reason that Celtic s figures are better due to 24m sale of Tierney to AFC in contrast to RangersFC 0 7m profit As manager Steven Gerrard said The numbers could have looked very different if we had accepted a bid for one of our big assets
Clearly COVID has significantly impacted finances in 2019 20 with many clubs posting horrific losses e g Roma 184m Milan 176m Inter 90m Barcelona 87m and Juventus 81m These are all much worse than RangersFC 17m Benfica and Ajax both boosted by large player sales
Most Scottish Premiership clubs aim for break even so RangersFC 17 5m loss after tax is a big outlier especially compared to Celtic s small 0 4m deficit though the club from the blue side of Glasgow is very focused on an investment strategy to catch up their neighbours
However RangersFC wage bill surged 8 9m 26 to 43 3m while player amortisation impairment rose 1 2m 16 to 8 4m and other expenses increased 1 2m 6 to 23 4m Other operating income up 1 4m to 2 0m including 1 25m insurance payment for COVID interruption
The main driver of RangersFC revenue increase was the Europa League which was worth 20 7m compared to 14 3m prior year This led to growth in gate receipts up 3 7m 12 to 35 7m and broadcasting up 2 6m 24 to 13 5m Commercial fell 0 5m 5 to 9 8m
RangersFC pre tax loss widened from 11 4m to 17 8m despite revenue rising 5 9m 11 to 59 0m though profit on player sales fell 2 4m to 0 7m This was due to 11 5m 18 increase in operating expenses as the club invested in the first team After tax loss was 17 5m
RangersFC 2019 20 financial results cover a season when Scottish football was ended early in March due to COVID 19 though they were awarded second place in the Premiership based on average points They also reached the last 16 of the Europa League Some thoughts follow
About fucking time
I ll he absolutely amazed if Luiz isn t substituted at half time Should have happened already
And here s the 2 page executive summary of Tottenham Hotspur s 2019 20 financial results THFC
Final call for today s thread on Tottenham Hotspur s 2019 20 financials when they swung from Premier League s highest pre tax profit of 87m in prior season to 68m loss as revenue dropped 69m However potential of new stadium is evident THFC
Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on Tottenham Hotspur s 2019 20 financials when they swung from Premier League s highest pre tax profit of 87m in prior season to 68m loss as revenue dropped 69m However potential of new stadium is evident THFC
Apologies for the epic length of that thread on Tottenham Hotspur s 2019 20 financial results but there s a lot going on there For those who would prefer a more concise view here s the 2 page executive summary THFC
Thread on Tottenham Hotspur s 2019 20 financials when they swung from Premier League s highest pre tax profit of 87m in prior season to 68m loss as revenue dropped 69m However potential of new stadium evident as match day and commercial grew THFC
Levy warned The impact of the pandemic on our revenue is material and could not have come at a worse time having just completed a 1 2 bln stadium build financed by club resources and long term debt However these results also underline the potential of the new stadium
In the last decade THFC generated 1 1 bln cash from own operations but also needed to raise 746m from loans An incredible 1 4 bln has been invested in the new stadium and training centre leaving just 93m on players net 88m interest and 56m tax Cash balance up 215m
THFC generated an impressive 91m cash from operations but then spent 82m on the new stadium 59m net on new players 14m interest and 2m tax This was funded by 168m new loans thus increasing the cash balance by 103m to 226m
There was also significant growth in THFC transfer debt up from 88m to 140m only offset by 26m owed by other clubs so net 114m payable This has increased from just 26m in 2015 Gross transfer debt is 3rd highest in Premier League only behind LFC 167m and MUFC 149m
THFC interest payments as opposed to the accountants interest payable in the P L fell from 26m to 14m in 2019 20 following the debt refinancing However this was still the second highest in the Premier league only surpassed by MUFC 20m but more than AFC 11m
THFC 831m gross debt is by far the highest debt in the Premier League well ahead of MUFC 526m and is also the highest in Europe However thanks to the government loan cash increased from 123m to 226m so net debt was only up 71m from 534m to 605m
THFC gross debt rose 173m from 658m to 831m comprising 633m for the stadium 175m from the government COVID facility and 23m from Investec for the new training ground In September 2019 stadium loans were refinanced into long term maturities average 23 years at 2 67
It is remarkable that THFC have done so well on the pitch despite only averaging 35m net spend in the last 5 years though up from 2m in preceding 5 years Since these accounts closed Spurs have spent a net 98m to bring in Lo Celso Reguilon Doherty Höjbjerg and Rodon
That said THFC player purchases increased from 22m to 136m in 2019 20 including Tanguy Ndombélé from Lyon Steven Bergwijn from PSV Eindhoven Ryan Sessegnon from FFC Jack Clarke from LUFC However to place this in context CFC spent 281m and LFC 223m in 2018 19
Following this increase THFC player amortisation of 75m is 7th highest in England but still well below the likes of big spending CFC 168m MCFC 127m and MUFC 123m Also below EFC 95m which highlights Spurs relatively low transfer spend
THFC player amortisation the annual charge to expense transfer fees over the length of a player s contract rose 28m 59 from 47m to 75m due to investment in the squad This has more than doubled from 31m in 2016
THFC depreciation shot up 46m from 25m to 71m driven by a full year in the new stadium This is by far the highest charge in the Premier League over 50m more than MUFC 19m and AFC 15m though worth noting this is a non cash flow expense
THFC chairman Daniel Levy remuneration fell from 7m to 3m as no repeat of bonus for completing the stadium so now only 2nd second highest in the Premier League behind Ed Woodward at MUFC He has trousered a cool 34m in last 11 years though improved Money League ranking
THFC wages to turnover ratio increased from 39 to 46 though this is still the lowest best in the Premier League 10 below MUFC To highlight how efficient Spurs are they had the 2nd lowest ratio of the top 20 Money League clubs in 2018 19 e g only half of Roma s 78
Even after growth in recent years THFC 181m wage bill is still miles behind the rest of the Big Six who are all at least 100m more than Spurs except for AFC who are around 50m higher In 2018 19 their wages were firmly in the bottom half of European top 20 clubs
THFC wage bill rose slightly 3m to 181m In the last 4 years revenue has shot up by 182m while wages have only grown 81m which is testament to Spurs ability to keep costs down Expectation is that other clubs will see wages drop in 2019 20 e g MUFC down 48m
THFC two major commercial deals increased in last 2 years a AIA shirt sponsorship extended to 2027 up from 35m to 40m b Nike replaced Under Armour in 2018 doubling money from 15m to 30m running to 2033 However these long term deals run the risk of being overtaken
THFC 162m commercial revenue is now 51m higher than AFC 111m though Arsenal will rise by around 40m in 2019 20 with new sponsorship deals for Adidas and Emirates Still way behind MUFC 279m and MCFC 227m though new stadium should help close the gap e g NFL games
Thanks to the opportunities offered by the new stadium THFC commercial revenue rose 27m 19 from 135m to 162m even though many events had to be cancelled due to COVID Has shot up from 59m in 2016 with the highest growth rate of Big Six albeit from a low base
THFC splendid new stadium has a 62 000 capacity though there were lengthy delays and the total cost was 1 2 bln Nevertheless it will drive significant revenue growth while the club is pushing for a 25m naming rights deal more challenging due to COVID
As 5 games were played without fans THFC average attendance fell from 54 217 to 43 757 the 4th highest in the Premier League only below MUFC 57 415 AFC 47 589 and WHUFC 44 134 Spurs match day contributed 24 of total revenue around the same as AFC
THFC 95m match day revenue has overtaken MUFC 90m and is only behind AFC 96m which will fall in 2019 20 In fact based on incredible 5 9m per match for games played with fans Spurs revenue would have been as high as 124m in a normal season a PL record
THFC match day income rose 13m 16 from 82m to 95m following the move to the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium all but 5 games at Wembley prior season despite 5 home games being played behind closed doors Split 82m Premier League and 13m Champions League and other cups
The importance of the Champions League to THFC revenue growth is clearly evident as they have received 278m from this competition in the last 4 years only surpassed by MCFC 307m Most tellingly this is 117m more than AFC 161m in the same period
It is worth noting the big financial differences in Europe e g MUFC reached Europa League semi final but only got 25m while THFC received 61m in the Champions League despite only reaching last 16 Therefore Spurs will see revenue drop this season in the Europa League
THFC earned estimated 61m 69m after being eliminated in Champions League last 16 much less than prior season s 90m for reaching the final comprising 15m participation fee 19m prize money 23m UEFA coefficient and 12m TV pool This is before a 16 COVID rebate
Premier League has not published TV money details but EPL Handbook has illustrative example based on league place suggesting gross revenue fell from 145m to 138m 4th to 6th place less 15m rebate 11m per THFC accounts giving net 123m Some income deferred to 2020 21
TV money has driven THFC revenue growth in recent years but plunged 108m 44 from 244m to 136m domestic 85m Europe 51m due to revenue from 7 Premier League games slipping to 2020 21 accounts plus 11m rebate to broadcasters and lower Champions League money
Based on 2018 19 revenue THFC climbed two places from 10th to 8th in the Deloitte Money League which ranks clubs globally by revenue This meant that they were the highest placed club in London that season having overtaken both CFC and AFC
THFC 69m revenue decrease in 2019 20 is likely to be replicated elsewhere Indeed many European clubs have experienced similar falls MUFC 118m Barcelona 102m Juventus 77m and Milan 45m In percentage terms Spurs 15 decline is actually a bit better than average
THFC 392m revenue is now around the same level as AFC 395m though the Gunners figure is likely to be lower when they publish COVID impacted 2019 20 accounts That said Spurs are still a fair way behind the other leading clubs e g MUFC were nearly 120m higher
In fact THFC have enjoyed the highest percentage revenue growth of the Big Six since 2016 In absolute terms Spurs 182m growth has only been surpassed by LFC 231m Furthermore Spurs have eliminated a 141m deficit against their North London rivals AFC
Despite the 69m fall in 2020 THFC revenue has still grown by 182m 87 since 2016 from 210m to 392m mainly commercial 103m and match day 54m However chairman Daniel Levy has estimated revenue loss for current year as an irrecoverable 150m if stadium remains closed
At an operating level i e excluding player sales and interest THFC made a 40m loss the first time they have not posted a profit since 2015 In fairness very few Premier League clubs post operating profits while Spurs 96m in 2018 19 was the highest in Europe
THFC EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered a proxy for cash operating profit as it strips out player sales and exceptional items fell from 168m to a still respectable 106m 4th highest in the Premier League
To reinforce the point that player sales have been a major part of THFC financial success in the 5 years up to 2019 they made a sizeable 172m from this activity only surpassed by CFC 332m and LFC 306m In contrast MCFC and MUFC made just 147m and 69m respectively
Player sales have had a big impact on THFC figures with 166m coming from this activity in last 5 years though worth noting they have been profitable even without this in 4 of those years Club record of 104m came in 2014 from lucrative sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid
This is the first year that THFC have reported a loss since way back in 2012 and that was only 7m In the intervening 7 seasons they have generated an impressive 412m of profits averaging 59m a year In 2018 and 2019 alone they delivered a hefty 226m
THFC bottom line only benefited from 15m profit on player sales albeit up from prior year s 11m mainly Christian Eriksen to Inter and Kieran Trippier to Atletico Madrid This was much lower than some other clubs CFC 60m LCFC 58m CPFC 46m and LFC 45m
In this way the pandemic has significantly impacted finances in 2019 20 with many leading clubs posting horrific losses e g Roma 184m Milan 176m Inter 90m Barcelona 87m and Juventus 81m From that perspective THFC 64m after tax does not seem too bad
COVID has significantly impacted revenue with some deferred into the 2020 21 accounts while 5 matches were played behind closed doors retail stores were closed stadium tours and conferences were halted for 3 months and none of the contracted summer events could take place
THFC 68m loss is largest of the 3 Premier League clubs that have published 2019 20 accounts much higher than MUFC 21m and is actually 14th worst ever in the PL However all clubs likely to report worse numbers last season e g Spurs had highest 87m profit in 2018 19
Completion of the new THFC stadium meant a big increase in depreciation which rose 46m from 25m to 71m Interest payable up 18m from 25m to 43m 21m bank interest plus 25m notional interest per IFRS 16 No repeat of prior year s 6m profit from property disposals
THFC wage bill rose 3m 1 to 182m while player amortisation surged 28m 59 from 47m to 75m However other expenses decreased 10m 8 to 104m partly due to rental paid for the use of Wembley Stadium in the previous season
Main driver of THFC revenue fall is broadcasting down 108m 44 to 136m due to Premier League deferral rebate and reaching Champions League final prior season However new stadium led to growth in match day up 13m 16 to 95m and commercial up 26m 19 to 162m
THFC swung from 87m profit before tax to 68m loss a deterioration of 155m Revenue dropped 69m 15 from club record 461m to 392m including exceptional 11m TV rebate while profit on player sales rose 4m to 15m and expenses increased 85m After tax loss was 64m
Tottenham Hotspur s 2019 20 financial results covered a season that was disrupted by the COVID 19 pandemic but they still benefited from the new stadium The club finished sixth in the Premier League and reached the last 16 in the Champions League Some thoughts follow THFC
Never quite realized how much Maradona was adored until I saw him in Napoli Even though I was with the away fans and also chanted against him we all knew he was a gigantic talent
Final call for today s thread on CelticFC financial results for 2019 20 when they posted a small 0 1m pre tax profit 0 4m loss after tax despite revenue falling 13m due to COVID Figures boosted by 24m profit on player sales Tierney to Arsenal
If that Celtic thread is too detailed for your liking here s the executive summary of their 2019 20 financial results CelticFC
Thread covering Celtic s financial results for 2019 20 season when they posted a small 0 1m pre tax profit 0 4m loss after tax despite revenue falling 13m due to COVID Figures boosted by 24m profit on player sales Tierney to Arsenal CelticFC
This year s figures will likely see a large loss due to COVID but CelticFC remain committed to the strategy of careful use of our financial resources This will probably mean the profitable sale of some of their better players like talented French striker Odsonne Edouard
Over the last 10 years CelticFC have had 54m available cash entirely generated from their operations Highest expenditure infrastructure 20m debt repayment 8m dividends 5m tax 4m and interest 1m Broke even on player trading Bank balance increased by 17m
As a result CelticFC cash balance dropped from 34 1m to 22 4m though this was still by far the highest in Scotland more than double Rangers 11 1m
CelticFC lost 3 6m cash from operating activities in 2019 20 then spent 3 9m net on player purchases 1 2m on in infrastructure and 0 4m tax They also repaid 2 1m of loans and paid 0 5m dividends on the preference shares leading to 11 7m net cash outflow
CelticFC 5 3m debt is second largest in Scotland but a long way below Rangers 19 3m which would have been even higher without the club from Ibrox converting 34 3m of loans into shares in last 2 seasons Note Celtic s figures excludes 4 2m convertible preference shares
CelticFC gross debt is only 5 3m with a 22 4m cash balance producing net funds of 17 1m The debt comprises 4 1m Co operative bank loans LIBOR 3 plus 1 2m finance leases Post year end revolving credit facility was increased from 2m to 13m as a buffer if required
CelticFC player purchases of 21m was easily more than the rest of the Scottish Premiership combined next highest Rangers 11m Acquisitions included Christopher Julien Patryk Klimala Boli Bolingoli Ismaila Soro and Hatem Abd Elhamed
CelticFC invested record sums into the playing squad with 21m on purchases in 2019 20 though they still reported net sales of 4m The last time the club had net spend was 10m in 2017 though similar sum spent this season
As a rule Scottish clubs do not pay big money to sign players meaning that their player amortisation charge is normally very low In fact CelticFC and Rangers are the only clubs booking more than 500k a year though Celtic s 12 2m is much more than Rangers 7 6m
As a result of investment in the squad CelticFC player amortisation the annual cost of writing off transfer fees increased by 2 5m 25 from 9 7m to 12 2m which means that this expense has more than doubled in just four years from 5 0m in 2016
Just for a bit of fun a comparison with the Premier League shows that CelticFC 56m wage bill in 2018 19 was lower than every club with the exception of Cardiff City 54m The English Big Six wages were 3 6 times as much MUFC 332m THFC 179m
The deterioration of CelticFC wages to turnover ratio to 77 means that this is the highest of the three Scottish Premiership clubs that have published 2019 20 accounts to date worse than Rangers 73 and Aberdeen 68
Similar to revenue Rangers have closed the wages gap to CelticFC in the last 3 years from 35m in 2018 to 11m in 2020 There remains an abyss between the Old Firm and the other Scottish clubs e g the next highest are Aberdeen 10m Hearts 8m and Hibernian 6m
CelticFC trimmed their wage bill by 1 8m 3 from 56 1m to 54 3m so this has fallen by 5m 8 from the 59m peak in 2018 though revenue fall means the wages to turnover ratio has increased from 58 to 77
CelticFC have a new 5 year kit deal with Adidas from July 2020 described as the biggest kit sponsorship ever to be announced across Scottish sport Similarly the Dafabet deal runs until 2025 and is the most lucrative sponsorship agreement in Scottish football history
CelticFC commercial revenue fell 3 6m 15 from 24 4m to 20 8m comprising commercial sponsorship 8 1m retail and e commerce 11 2m and other income 1 4m This is by far the highest in Scotland well ahead of Rangers 9 8m Aberdeen 7 7m and Hearts 6 1m
Match day revenue is particularly important for Scottish clubs given the low TV deal According to Deloitte this accounts for an incredible 48 of total revenue in Scotland with the next highest being Belgium 26 Thus live streams help to protect a key income stream
However CelticFC average attendance increased from 56 729 to 57 857 nearly 9 000 more than Rangers 49 238 This season the fans purchase of season tickets despite uncertainty around when they can return to the stadium has exceeded all expectations
CelticFC match day income fell 7 5m 17 from 43 3m to 35 8m as 4 Premiership home games were not played after the season s early closure This was just ahead of Rangers 35 7m then a big drop to Hearts 6 0m and Aberdeen 3 7m
It is therefore significant that recent good performances in Europe by CelticFC and Rangers have improved Scotland s UEFA coefficient thus almost guaranteeing that the 2021 22 Scottish champions will automatically qualify for the Champions League group stage
European qualification is extremely important for CelticFC who have earned 98m from Europe in last 5 years almost 5 times as much as Rangers 17m Champions League is the real differentiator with Celtic getting over 30m in both 2017 2018 when they reached group stage
Based on my estimate CelticFC earned 11 2m from reaching Europa League last 32 split between starting fee 2 75m prize money 4 6m UEFA coefficient 2 3m TV pool 1 6m Also received 1 1m for 3 qualifying rounds in Champions League About the same as prior season
In total CelticFC broadcasting revenue fell 2 0m 13 from 15 7m to 13 7m just ahead of Rangers 13 5m then a big gap to Hearts and Aberdeen both 3 0m The decrease was due to League being curtailed and Scottish Cup not being completed
There is a new five year Scottish Premiership TV deal with Sky Sports worth 30m a year from 2020 21 but this is not really going to move the needle For example it s still only around half of Poland s Ekstraklasa 58m
In contrast Scottish Premiership TV deal is very low so CelticFC only received 3 4m for winning the title To put this into perspective Premier League winners got 152m while last place was worth 97m Even a Championship club no parachute payments got twice as much 7m
Of course the comparison is a bit misleading as English clubs benefit from huge TV money Comparing CelticFC with West Ham match day is 8m higher commercial is only 4m lower so the Glaswegians revenue would be higher with the same TV deal placing them 7th in England
For some more perspective CelticFC 83m revenue in 2018 19 was 36m lower than the bottom club in the Premier League namely Huddersfield Town with 119m
This is at the heart of CelticFC issue i e they are the proverbial big fish in a small pond In 2018 19 the Scottish Premiership generated 240m revenue miles below the likes of England 5 9 bln and Spain 3 4 bln but also behind Belgium 344m and Austria 256m
This might seem like a somewhat pointless comparison but the fact is that in 2004 CelticFC were placed as high as 13th in the Money League Since then their revenue has only grown by 14m while the club in 20th place has increased by 127m and the top club by 570m
To highlight the magnitude of CelticFC challenge their 83m revenue in 2018 19 was around 70 below the 154m required to be in the Top 30 European clubs as shown in the Deloitte Money League which ranks clubs globally by revenue
The Old Firm generate significantly more revenue than other Scottish clubs For example CelticFC 70m is more than four times as much as Hearts 15m and Aberdeen 14m followed by Hibernian 11m Kilmarnock 7m Motherwell 5m and St Mirren 4m
CelticFC have enjoyed a substantial revenue advantage over their rivals Rangers in recent times but the gap has narrowed over the last three years from 69m in 2018 to 11m in 2020
CelticFC revenue has now fallen 31m from the 102m high two years ago to 70m mainly driven by 20m media rights but also match day 7m and commercial 4m On the other hand revenue is up by more than a third 18m from 52m in 2016
CelticFC operating loss i e excluding player sales widened from 6 2m to 24 5m in 2019 20 down from a 5m profit in 2016 17 Although most clubs post operating losses this is the highest in Scotland around 9m worse than Rangers 15 9m deficit
Profits from player sales have made a big difference to CelticFC bottom line In the last eight years they have generated 102m profit from player trading compared to just 6m in the same period at Rangers
The two CelticFC player sales that have generated the highest proceeds both came in the last two seasons Tierney to Arsenal 24m and Moussa Dembélé to Lyon 20m Southampton have proved a lucrative market with four sales over 7m to the South coast club
CelticFC strategy has become increasingly reliant on player trading with profits from player sales averaging 19m a season in the last 3 years Money earned does not only include the initial sales proceeds but also sell on fees e g Virgil van Dijk from Southampton to LFC
CelticFC have posted pre tax profits five years in a row amounting to a 36m surplus in that period In fact they have generated profits in seven of the last eight seasons with the sole loss in 2014 15 being only 4m
However CelticFC figures greatly benefited from 24m profit from player sales up 6m 37 from previous season s 18m mainly Kieran Tierney to Arsenal This was significantly higher than other Scottish clubs e g Rangers only made 0 7m from this activity
COVID has significantly impacted finances in 2019 20 with many leading clubs posting horrific losses e g Roma 184m Milan 176m Inter 90m Barcelona 87m and Juventus 81m In contrast CelticFC demonstrated the sustainable nature and flexibility of the business model
CelticFC chairman Ian Bankier said These results are satisfactory in the circumstances Given the impact of the pandemic a 0 1m profit 0 4m loss after tax is a fine achievements especially compared to the 17 8m loss 17 5m after tax reported by Rangers
CelticFC revenue had risen 3m 7 from 50m to 53m in the first half of 2019 20 but it fell 16m 49 from 33m to 17m in the second half of the season Club estimates COVID revenue impact as 9 1m 7 4m due to early season close and 1 7m retail and hospitality
CelticFC wages fell 1 8m 3 from 56 1m to 54 3m while other costs were cut 5 2m 18 from 28 9m to 23 7m due to less activity However non cash flow expenses increased player amortisation rose 2 5m 26 to 12 2m while depreciation was up 0 6m 28 to 2 6m
All three CelticFC revenue streams were lower especially match day which fell 7 5m 17 from 43 3m to 35 8m Commercial dropped 3 6m 15 from 24 4m to 20 8m while broadcasting was also down 2 0m 13 from 15 7m to 13 7m
Due to COVID CelticFC pre tax profit dropped from 11 3m to 0 1m as revenue fell 13m 16 from 83m to 70m offset by 6m increase in profit on player sales to 24m and 4m reduction in expenses However no repeat of prior season s 9m compensation for Brendan Rodgers
Celtic s 2019 20 accounts cover a season when Scottish football was ended early in March due to COVID 19 though they were declared champions for the 9th consecutive season based on average points They also reached the last 32 of Europa League Some thoughts follow CelticFC
Final call for today s thread on Olympique Lyonnais financial results for 2019 20 a season where Ligue 1 was ended early but club reached Champions League semi finals Swung from 8m pre tax profit to 36m loss TeamOL

For those who prefer an executive summary instead of a detailed analysis here s the 2 page overview of Olympique Lyonnais 2019 20 financial results TeamOL
Thread on Olympique Lyonnais financial results for 2019 20 a season where Ligue 1 was ended early but club reached Champions League semi finals Swung from 8m pre tax profit to 36m loss TeamOL
Of course these projections depend on how the COVID crisis develops so there will be more short term pain before TeamOL can resume its growth trajectory Meanwhile they have started a court case against the LFP to compensate for losses suffered after ending the season early
TeamOL remain confident of achieving 420 440m revenue including player trading and 100 EBITDA in 2023 24 partly based on building a new events venue near the stadium 140m investment and developing a leisure entertainment complex in OL Valley
In the last decade TeamOL have spent over 400m on infrastructure including 362m on the new stadium This has been funded by 226m of new equity and 163m loans Player sales net of 186m largely covered 137m operating losses and 79m interest payments
TeamOL have benefited from their interest payments steadily falling from a peak of 31m in 2017 to only 6m in 2020 thanks to various refinancings During the last nine years the club has had to pay nearly 80m in interest
Team OL 21m cash increase in 2019 20 was entirely due to 91m from net player sales This was used to cover a 43m operating loss and 8m capital expenditure while they also spent 10m on loan repayments and 6m on interest payments
However TeamOL transfer debt shot up in 2020 from 41m to 136m while amounts owed to Lyon by other clubs fell from 94m to 34m resulting in net transfer payables of 101m This would have been the highest gross transfer debt in France in 2019 ahead of PSG 120m
French clubs often hold a higher cash balance than say English clubs so TeamOL 12m cash balance in 2018 19 was only mid table in Ligue 1 However this rose to 33m in 2019 20 then up to 49m as of 30 September 2020
In light of the COVID crisis TeamOL has strengthened its liquidity by a increasing its revolving credit facility to 115m b taking out a 93m government guaranteed loan with a 12 months maturity can exercise a 1 5 year amortisation option
As a result of investment in the new stadium TeamOL gross debt of 222m was by far the highest in France in 2018 19 well ahead of Lille 129m and Bordeaux 38m The club negotiated 9m of postponements of loan repayments last season due to COVID
TeamOL gross debt rose 5m to 227m as IFRS 16 meant inclusion of 10m finance leases Stadium debt up 3m to 161m but other financial liabilities down 9m to 55m Cash increased 21m to 33m so net financial debt fell 16m from 210m to 194m
TeamOL had net spend of 62m in 2020 purchases 153m sales 92m the first time they have not reported net spend since 2011 and that was just 3m Big increases in both purchases and sales over last 5 years Buys included Andersen Reine Adelaide Mendes and Guimaraes
To some extent TeamOL have been playing catch up here with their player amortisation only fourth highest in Ligue 1 in 2018 19 below PSG 123m Monaco 69m and Marseille 43m
Following an increase in player spend TeamOL player amortisation the annual cost of writing off transfer fees increased by 22m 69 from 32m to 55m which means that this expense has more than tripled in just three years from just 14m in 2017
Following the steep decline in revenue TeamOL wages to turnover ratio increased worsened from 59 to 73 Pre COVID in 2018 19 Lyon had the fourth lowest in Ligue 1 with the only clubs better than them being Amiens 54 PSG 56 and Strasbourg 59
In 2018 19 TeamOL 131m wages were the third highest in Ligue 1 sandwiched between Monaco 147m and Marseille 127m but nearly quarter a billion below PSG 371m That said there was also a big gap to the other French clubs Lille 72m Rennes 64m and Bordeaux 60m
TeamOL wages rose slightly from 131m to 132m as the 21m reduction from placing players and other staff on partial unemployment under the French government s economic support programme did not fully offset the 22m increase from strengthening the squad
TeamOL will benefit from two new 5 year sponsorship agreements in 2020 21 Emirates have replaced Hyundai as shirt sponsor for a reported 20m while Adidas have extended their kit deal at 10m Groupama stadium 4m naming rights extended to 2022
Before the pandemic struck TeamOL commercial income had been steadily rising In 2018 19 their 57m was ahead of Marseille 50m Monaco 33m and Saint Etienne 26m but like every other French club was dwarfed by PSG s extraordinary 452m
TeamOL commercial revenue fell 9m 17 from 57 to 48m comprising sponsorship advertising 27m brand related revenue 14m and events 7m Adversely impacted by the mid March shutdown including lower merchandising sales and cancelled events
European qualification particularly Champions League is extremely important for TeamOL who have earned an impressive 262m from Europe in last 5 seasons only surpassed in France by PSG 406m but well ahead of Monaco 169m and Marseille 44m
It is worth noting the influence on Champions League distribution of the UEFA coefficient payment introduced in 2018 19 based on performances over 10 years where TeamOL received around 18m in 2019 20 compared to 29m for PSG and 4m for Lille
TeamOL earned 90m after reaching the Champions League semi final 20m more than prior season Other French clubs PSG 133m Lille 37m These figures are before any COVID rebate while 25m revenue for games played in August has been shifted to 2020 21 accounts
French TV rights should increase by around 60 in 2020 21 from 830m to 1 3 bln based on contracts signed by Mediapro BeIN and Free which TeamOL estimate is worth an additional 18m However Mediapro want to renegotiate and have not made their second payment this season
Although domestic TV money was hit by the season closing early TeamOL did benefit from financial assistance of 12 9m from the French government reported as an Exceptional Item This was equivalent to the balance of LFP media rights that the club did not receive
TeamOL earned 48m from Ligue 1 TV deal in 2019 behind PSG 60m but ahead of Marseille 47m Money distributed by 50 30 20 rule 50 equal share 30 fixed 20 according to club licences 30 league standing 25 current season 5 5 previous seasons 20 media profile
TeamOL TV income fell 24m 20 from 122m to 98m Domestic was down 18m 35 from 51m to 33m due to rebate to broadcasters and 7th place vs 3rd UEFA TV money was down 6m 9 from 71m to 65m Only below PSG 157m in France in 2018 19
TeamOL average attendance fell from 49 079 to 47 299 which was the third highest in France only behind Marseille 52 804 and PSG 47 554 Club moved to the 59 186 capacity Groupama Stadium Parc Olympique Lyonnais from the Stade de Garland in January 2016
TeamOL gate receipts fell 6m 15 from 42m to 36m comprising domestic 24m and Europe 12m Hit hard by termination of Ligue 1 season on 13 March meaning 6 home games were not played Champions League quarter final and semi final played behind closed doors in Lisbon
After a six year absence TeamOL returned to the 2018 19 Deloitte Money League which ranks clubs globally by revenue with their 221m securing 17th place just behind AS Roma 231m Around a third of their Champions League semi final winners Bayern Munich 660m
That said TeamOL 221m in 2018 19 was enough to enjoy a revenue advantage of around 100m over Marseille 130m and Monaco 112m followed by Rennes 80m Saint Etienne 74m Bordeaux 71m and Lille 64m
TeamOL revenue growth has outpaced Marseille and Monaco but their challenge is highlighted by PSG s stratospheric increase since the club was acquired by QSI in 2011 In that year Lyon s revenue was 32m higher than PSG but the shortfall in 2019 was a massive 438m
Despite the 40m fall in 2019 20 TeamOL revenue has still grown 84m 88 in the last 5 years from 96m in 2015 to 181m mainly driven by broadcasting 52m Champions League success match day 24m impact of moving to new stadium and commercial 8m
TeamOL operating loss excluding player sales widened from 55m to 101m in 2019 20 In the previous season they were 5th worst in Ligue 1 only beaten by Monaco 153m Marseille 109m Lille 95m and Bordeaux 61m Only one club made an operating profit Nimes 3m
Even in 2018 19 most French clubs posted negative EBITDA excluding player sales with Monaco leading the way with 96 m TeamOL basically broke even and were 6th best in Ligue 1 Only PSG had a positive EBITDA higher than 5m with an impressive 77m
TeamOL EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation had steadily risen to 77m but fell to 46m in 2020 which was not bad given the difficult economic background Excluding profit on player sales dropped to minus 37m
TeamOL player sale profits have been based on steady business as opposed to one mega transaction with four deals above 40m Lacazette to AFC 50m Ndombele to THFC 48m Mendy to Real Madrid 43m Tolisso to Bayern 41m Sales proceeds for 2020 21 already above 50m
n fact the only club that has done better financially in player sales in France is Monaco who made an incredible 638m in the five years up to 2019 However TeamOL 296m is ahead of the rest PSG 245m Lille 177m and Marseille 114m
TeamOL have made significant profits from player sales including 371m in the last 5 seasons averaging 74m a year Their strategy is based on a top notch academy recruitment of very talented young players and an ability to unlock their sporting and economic potential
TeamOL 36m loss in 2019 20 is the first they have reported since 2015 Before that they had accumulated 43m of profits in the previous four years though this has now almost completely been offset in a single season Club expects another loss in 2020 21
TeamOL figures were boosted by profit on player sales rising 6m from 77m to 83m mainly Tanguy Ndombele to THFC proceeds 48m Lucas Tousart to Hertha Berlin 21m and Nabil Fekir to Real Betis 20m Second highest in France in 2018 19 only behind Monaco 155m
In 2018 19 the last full season for Ligue 1 clubs TeamOL profit before tax of 8m was third best in France only surpassed by Paris Saint Germain 32m and Toulouse 12m Even before the pandemic struck some clubs posted large losses i e Marseille 91m and Lille 67m
TeamOL operating loss from COVID estimated as 58m as 100m revenue reduction match day 25m broadcasting 6m commercial 18m player sales 50m was partly offset by 42m cost savings wages 21m other expenses 21m
TeamOL revenue had risen 42m 19 to record levels in the first 9 months of 2019 20 but it fell off a cliff in the last 3 months Club estimates COVID revenue impact as 100m 50m operating revenue and 50m player sales as transfer window shifted to 2020 21
The main driver of TeamOL cost increase was player amortisation which grew 22m 69 from 32m to 55m while wages were up slightly 2m to 132m Other expenses were cut 5m 5 to 85m but net interest payable rose 4m 28 to 18m
All three TeamOL revenue streams were lower especially broadcasting which fell 24m 20 from 122m to 98m Commercial dropped 10m 17 from 57m to 47m while gate receipts were down 6m 15 from 42m to 36m
Due to COVID TeamOL swung from 8m pre tax profit to 36m loss as revenue fell 40m 18 from 221m to 181m though partly offset by 13m government aid and profit on player sales rising 6m to 83m Also adversely impacted by 25m increase in costs
It is also worth noting the continued success of TeamOL women s team who achieved a clean sweep in 2019 20 winning their 14th consecutive French league title 7th Champions League 9th Coupe de France and the first edition of the Trophée des Championnes
The Olympique Lyonnais 2019 20 accounts cover a season when Ligue 1 was ended early in March due to COVID 19 with TeamOL in 7th place However they reached the semi finals of Champions League Coupe de France and final of Coupe de la Ligue Some thoughts in the following thread
I just realised that I forgot to share the new 2 page summary of Norwich City s 2019 20 financial results after yesterday s detailed thread so here it is NCFC
Final call for today s thread on Norwich City s financial results for the 2019 20 season Despite being relegated from the Premier League and the impact of COVID 19 NCFC still generated their highest ever revenue and posted a small profit
Thread on Norwich City s financial results for the 2019 20 season Despite being relegated from the Premier League and the impact of COVID 19 NCFC still generated their highest ever revenue and posted a small profit
NCFC COO Ben Kensell concluded We re very proud of our robust and self financed model which is helping us sustain the club in this difficult and challenging financial climate though there is no escaping that the impact of COVID 19 will be felt for the coming years
Unlike many Championship clubs NCFC have no FFP concerns as their 19m loss over the 3 year monitoring period is lower than 61m limit 2 Championship years of 13m one Premier League year of 35m even before allowable deductions 18m and promotion bonus 11m
Since 2012 NCFC have generated available cash of 126m from operating activities Most of this 44m went on the playing squad while the club also spent 22m on infrastructure 10m interest and 10m loan repayments In addition cash balance rose 40m
As prior year 20m overdraft was cleared NCFC cash balance increased by 42m to 62m but this is a little misleading as the club has to repay its short term 10m loan by May and there is another 18m of deferred tax payments agreed with HMRC during the lockdown
Largely thanks to a big increase in creditors NCFC generated 57m cash from operations supplemented by 3m net player sales and a 10m loan Spent 6m on infrastructure 13m in last 2 years and 2m interest which meant 62m net cash inflow
NCFC paid 2 5m interest in 2019 20 as their short term bank loan charged a chunky 5 2 This was 8th highest in the Premier League and is the largest annual payment that Norwich have made since 2013
In addition NCFC also owe 8m transfer fees for stage payments on previous purchases but this is very low compared to other clubs e g LFC 167m and MUFC 149m Worth noting they have to pay up to 45m if certain contractual conditions are met like promotion
NCFC 14m debt was one of the smallest in the Premier League much lower than some other clubs though many of these have taken on debt for new stadiums or training grounds e g THFC 466m MUFC 526m EFC 337m BHAFC 280m and AFC 217m
NCFC gross debt fell from 24m to 14m including 10 5m bank loan secured on TV money due for repayment in My 2021 2 3m Canary Bond and 250k from directors to help fund the new training ground Also includes 1 4m preference shares classified as debt
It might surprise fans that NCFC have increased their gross spend in the transfer market in the last 5 years though the 20m annual average is not that big They have averaged 1m of net sales in that period which will increase in 2020 21 thanks to sales of Godfrey and Lewis
NCFC player purchases were 18m which was the lowest in the Premier League but higher than Norwich s spend in the previous two seasons 2017 18 15m 2018 19 10m Even though few players arrived last year this included payments on previous purchases contingent on promotion
As a consequence NCFC player amortisation of 9m was by far the lowest in the Premier League with the next smallest being 32m For more context this is at least 100m below big spending clubs like CFC 168m MCFC 127m MUFC 126m and LFC 112m
NCFC player amortisation the annual charge to expense transfer fees over a player s contract surprisingly fell slightly after promotion to 8 6m down from the 18 6m peak in 2016 This highlights the club s limited investment in players
None of the NCFC directors received any remuneration in 2019 20 presumably due to the impact of COVID In the previous season the highest paid director received 480k
Following the big increase in revenue in the Premier League NCFC wages to turnover ratio improved from 152 to 75 though this was still one of the highest in the Premier League However other clubs ratios likely to deteriorate when they publish 2019 20 accounts
Despite the increase exacerbated by the accounts covering 13 months NCFC 89m wage bill was still one of the smallest in the Premier League so it is perhaps not surprising that they struggled to compete For some perspective it was less than a third of MUFC 284m
NCFC underlying wage bill rose by 38m 74 from 51m to 89m following promotion previous season included sizeable promotion bonuses as many players were given new deals Player contracts have relegation clauses reportedly 50 so wages will be much lower in Championship
Following promotion NCFC signed Dafabet as their new shirt sponsor in a deal described as the most lucrative partnership the club has ever had by some way though fee will be lower in Championship One of 12 new partners signed last summer The kit suppler remains Errea
Most impressively NCFC commercial income rose 7m 48 from 14m to 21m as sponsorship increased tripled from 3 4m to 10 3m Includes 4 6m catering though not too surprising with Delia Smith as an owner Very respectable figure compared to similar sized clubs
Obviously all clubs saw their average attendances fall in the COVID impacted season but NCFC were still firmly in the bottom half of the Premier League only ahead of CPFC Burnley Watford and Bournemouth Season ticket prices have been frozen for eight years in a row
As some games were played without fans NCFC average attendance fell from 26 017 to 19 913 though this had improved by almost 1 000 to 27 005 before the pandemic struck with the number of season ticket holders up to 20 622
NCFC gate receipts fell by 2 1m 21 from 9 7m to 7 6m the lowest since 2010 as 5 games were played behind closed doors resulting in 3 1m rebate to season ticket holders Even without this adverse factor would have been in bottom half of the Premier League
NCFC TV money will fall following relegation though will be cushioned to some extent by parachute payment 43m in 2018 19 Will only receive 2 years 77m in total as relegated after one season Chief Operating Office Ben Kensell described these as massively important
Even after this rebate 76 of NCFC total revenue came from broadcasting though to be fair this is far from unusual in the top flight In fact 13 of the clubs in the Premier League earned more than 70 of their total income from TV
The Premier League has not yet published details of TV money distribution but the EPL Handbook contains an illustrative example based on league places suggesting that NCFC gross revenue was 95m less the 7m rebate giving a net 88m income
NCFC TV income shot up by 80m from 10m to 90m the club s highest ever from this revenue stream Would have been even higher without 7m rebate paid to broadcasters due to inferior product delayed games without fans As a result lower than other PL clubs 2018 19 figures
Despite the significant increase NCFC 119m revenue was still one of the lowest in the Premier League though the comparatives for all the clubs except MUFC are for the 2018 19 season i e before any impact from the pandemic That said clearly a huge gap to the Big Six
NCFC revenue obviously grew significantly after promotion by 86m to 119m though this would have been as high as 130m without the 10m COVID impact It was still 21m 22 higher than the 98m they generated the last time they were in the Premier League in 2016
At an operating level excluding player sales and interest NCFC made 3m profit the first time they have not posted a loss since 2014 Very few Premier League clubs enjoyed operating profits in 2018 19 so Norwich s small surplus is actually one of the best performances
Despite the improvement NCFC 14m EBITDA was still one of the lowest in the top flight though it is likely that other clubs will post lower figures than prior season when they publish their 2019 20 accounts
NCFC EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered as a proxy for cash operating profit as it strips out player sales and exceptional items rose from 24 m to 14m in the Premier League
Like most clubs NCFC bottom line is very influenced by player sales These averaged annual profit of 24m between 2015 and 2018 either leading to overall profit or lower losses The last 2 years have only averaged 2m but there will be large gains here in 2020 21
NCFC have been profitable in 6 of the last 9 years they made money in all 5 seasons in the Premier League but reported losses in 3 of the 4 Championship seasons The only exception was 18m in 2017 18 due to the significant 48m profit on player sales
Furthermore NCFC made money despite profit on player sales of only 1 6m the lowest in the Premier League as they decided to retain their talented young players In contrast they have realised significant value this summer with 40m sales of Ben Godfrey and Jamal Lewis
NCFC 2m profit is not huge but they have done well given that MUFC the only other club to post 2019 20 accounts to date lost 21m Finance Director Anthony Richens Despite COVID losses we can still post a profit which shows what the Premier League does for the club
NCFC underlying wage bill rose 38m 74 from 51m to 89m but player amortisation impairment and depreciation fell 1m 9 to 11m and no repeat of prior year 3 2m onerous contracts provision Other expenses almost doubled from 10m to 18m and interest up 0 6m to 2 1m
The main driver of NCFC 86m revenue increase was broadcasting up 81m to 90m due to much more lucrative Premier League TV deal though commercial also grew 7m 48 to 21m while gate receipts were down 2m 21 to 7 6m Profit on player sales fell 0 5m to 1 6m
As a technical aside the NCFC 2019 20 accounts were extended by a month to match the longer Premier League season so covered a 13 month period As a result the 2020 21 accounts will only cover 11 months
NCFC profit would have been 12 7m higher at 15m without the significant impact of COVID 19 Revenue was 10 2m lower due to rebates to broadcasters 7 1m and season ticket holders 3 1m while costs were higher after extending the season to July
Despite the impact of the pandemic NCFC swung from 39m pre tax loss in the Championship to 2m profit thanks to revenue surging 85m from 34m to club record 119m though competing in the Premier League increased expenses by 46m After tax went from 33m loss to 2m profit
Norwich City s 2019 20 accounts covered a challenging period for the club as they were relegated after just one season in the Premier League and their finances were impacted by the outbreak of COVID 19 Some thoughts in the following thread NCFC
Final call for today s thread on AS Roma s 2019 20 accounts when they reported a club record 204m loss the second highest ever in Italy Impacted by lack of Champions League lower player sales and COVID ASRoma
Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on AS Roma s 2019 20 accounts when they reported a club record 204m loss the second highest ever in Italy Impacted by lack of Champions League lower player sales and COVID ASRoma
If today s thread on AS Roma s financial results for the 2019 20 season is too detailed for you here s a handy two page executive summary ASRoma
Thread on AS Roma s 2019 20 accounts when they reported a club record 204m loss the second highest ever in Italy Impacted by lack of Champions League lower player sales and COVID ASRoma
Clearly ASRoma 2019 20 massive loss was impacted by COVID but that should not disguise their underlying problems partly caused by their failure to qualify for the lucrative Champions League e g high wages and debt Another capital injection from their owners is imperative
ASRoma have struggled to meet FFP targets in the past but UEFA have now relaxed their rules so the 2021 monitoring period will only cover 2 years 2018 and 2019 thus excluding the COVID 19 impacted 2020 In addition the 2022 monitoring period will now cover 4 years
ASRoma have been very reliant on capital from their owners The previously approved 150m for 2020 was increased to 210m of which 60m was paid in 2020 with remaining 150m to be paid by 31st December 2021 In addition 29m shareholder loan was converted into capital
In addition ASRoma owe 191m in transfer fees 27m higher than prior season This is the second highest in Italy only behind Juventus 301m Other clubs in turn owe Roma 55m so the net balance is 136m which is a sizeable rise from 18m just three years ago
ASRoma net interest payable rose 4m 14 to 32m the highest in Italy ahead of Inter 29m and Juventus 15m Interest rate on the bond is 5 125 which is lower than the previous loan s Euribor 3 months min 0 75 plus 6 25 though is still a major competitive burden
ASRoma gross debt of 318m is the third highest in Italy behind Inter 461m and Juventus 396m partly driven by new stadium In 2019 20 the club replaced the previous Goldman Sachs loan with the issue of a 275m bond to help restructure debt repayments
ASRoma net financial debt increased 79m from 221m to 300m as gross debt rose 63m from 255m to 318m with cash down from 35m to 18m Debt includes 267m bonds 28m finance leases due to IFRS 16 12m overdraft and 11m owner loans
It s a different story in gross spend with ASRoma 429m being the 4th highest in Italy though over 300m less than Juventus 758m Also behind Inter 522m and Milan 510m One interesting comparative is high flying Atalanta who are around half as much with 216m
In fact over the last 4 seasons ASRoma have one of the lowest net spends in Serie A or more accurately net sales of 27m In stark contrast the four biggest spenders over this period are Milan 276m Juventus 204m Inter 204m and Napoli 126m
ASRoma have significantly increased gross transfer spend averaging 107m in last 4 years but sales have increased even more to 114m which means they averaged 7m net sales 2019 20 player purchases included Pau Lopez Mancini Diawara Veretout Perez and Ibanez
As a result ASRoma player amortisation of 94m is the second highest in Italy though a long way below Juventus 167m Maybe surprisingly they are ahead of big spending Inter 85m Napoli 82m and Milan 80m
ASRoma player amortisation the annual cost of writing off transfer fees increased by 11m 13 from 83m to 94m which means that this expense has grown by an incredible 66m from 28m in 2014 i e more than tripling in that time
Following the increase from 63 to 104 ASRoma wages to turnover ratio is now the highest worst in Italy much higher than Juventus 70 Inter 52 and especially Atalanta 49 Also significantly above UEFA s recommended upper limit of 70 which is a cause for concern
ASRoma have 4th highest wage bill in Italy of 155m though a fair way below Juventus 284m Inter 193m Milan 185m though latter two may well fall when 19 20 COVID impacted accounts are published On the other hand above Napoli 135m and well ahead of Atalanta 69m
This encapsulates ASRoma s challenge as their wages have not grown since 2016 while other leading Italian clubs have all increased their wages over that period though some figures are pre COVID e g Inter up 68m and Juventus up 63m
ASRoma wage bill was cut 29m 16 from 184m to 155m mainly due to players coach and some other staff giving up 4 months salary from March to June saving 30m In last 2 years wages down 4m but revenue fell 104m increasing wages to turnover from 63 to 104
ASRoma player loans income up 4m to 7m including Schick to RB Leipzig and Defrei to Sassuolo Leading the way in Italy are Genoa 17m Roma were also boosted by 5m other player management though down from 15m mainly performance bonuses from previous player sales
ASRoma new owners will surely be looking to boost commercial income given the disparity with other leading European clubs Even before last season s significant decrease their 55m in 2018 19 was miles below likes of Barcelona 384m PSG 363m Bayern 357m MUFC 355m
ASRoma shirt sponsor Qatar Airways will pay 11m a year until 2021 while Hyundai back of shirt deal is worth 3m a year Nike kit deal 6m ended 3 years early in 2021 to look at other opportunities Long way behind Juventus 93m Jeep 42m Adidas 51m
ASRoma commercial income fell 20m 36 from 55m to 35m partly because of COVID but also cancellation of Betway agreement due to Italian regulatory changes prohibiting gambling advertising in football Now 6th highest in Serie A much lower than Juventus 186m
ASRoma continue to work on securing a new stadium but this has suffered many delays which may well be a reason that Pallotta sold the club He said If we want to consistently compete with the largest teams in Europe we need the stadium as can be seen by match day revenue
ASRoma average attendance decreased from 38 622 to 26 956 again due to 6 games in June and July being played behind closed doors This remained the 4th highest in Italy behind Inter 41 558 Milan 34 078 and Juventus 28 263 who all saw similar falls to Roma
ASRoma match day income fell 13m 39 from 34m to 21m split domestic 18m down 7m Europe 2m down 6m Impacted by playing 6 home games behind closed doors due to COVID This was 4th highest in Italy less than half Juventus 71m
The Champions League is extremely important for ASRoma who have earned an impressive 255m from Europe in last 5 seasons only surpassed in Italy by Juventus 449m but ahead of Napoli 246m Inter 117m Lazio 76m Atalanta 71m and Milan 29m
It is worth noting the influence on Champions League money of the UEFA coefficient payment based on performances over 10 years where ASRoma only received around 3m in the Europa League in 2019 20 compared to 12m from the Champions League in 2018 19
Based on my estimate ASRoma earned 18m from the Europa League after reaching the last 16 lower than prior season s 58m from the Champions League Other Italian clubs Juventus 87m Napoli 70m Atalanta 57m and Inter 57m These figures are before any COVID rebate
It is imperative that ASRoma do well in the Champions League to boost their broadcasting income as the TV rights in Serie A are relatively low Indeed there were big increases in England and Spain in 2019 20 and France in 2020 21 while Italy was unchanged
In 2018 19 ASRoma received 75m TV money from Serie A 50 equal share 30 performance 15 last season 10 last 5 years 5 historical and 20 supporters However 2019 20 revenue was lower as some income deferred to 2020 21 after some games played in July and August
ASRoma broadcasting income fell 59m 41 from 145m to 86m mainly due to 43m decrease in UEFA prize money from 58m to 14m though domestic TV also fell 15m 18 from 87m to 72m Down to 6th highest in Italy a long way below Juventus 166m
Based on 2018 19 revenue ASRoma dropped one place to 16th in the Deloitte Money League just ahead of Lyon West Ham and Everton though they must be in danger of dropping out of the top 20 in 2019 20 It is worth noting that they had been as high as 9th in 2007 08
In the last 4 years ASRoma have only grown revenue by 13m while Inter up 185m and Juventus up 60m have powered ahead In the same period they have also been outpaced by Atalanta Napoli and Lazio Only Milan and Fiorentina have a comparable low rate of growth
Following this decrease ASRoma 149m revenue is now 5th highest in Italy over 250m below Juventus 407m though Inter Milan and Napoli will surely fall when they publish 2019 20 accounts due to COVID Revenue mix TV 58 commercial 23 match day 14 player loans 5
ASRoma 104m 41 revenue fall since 2018 from 253m to 149m highlights the importance of qualifying for Europe particularly the Champions League This was worth 98m in 2018 TV 84m plus match day 15m but only 17m in 2020 TV 14m plus match day 2m
Similarly ASRoma operating loss excluding profit from player sales and interest payable widened from 131m to 195m down from 47m only 2 years ago This is second worst in Serie A only beaten by Juventus 234m though they offset this with much higher player sales
ASRoma EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered a proxy for underlying profitability as it excludes once off items like player sales and exceptional items fell from 44 m to 90 m the worst in Italy by far
Profit on player sales had been increasingly important for ASRoma averaging 89m a year over the preceding 4 years before dropping to 18m in 2020 Next summer they will hope to realise profits on some players currently out on loan e g Florenzi Under Kluivert and Olsen
ASRoma are no strangers to losses though 204m is their highest since 115m in 2003 In fact the last time they made a profit before tax was back in 2009 and that was just 3m Since then they have suffered losses 11 years in a row adding up to nearly half a billion
ASRoma loss was not helped by profit on player sales falling from 129m to just 18m mainly El Shaaraway to Shanghai 13m and Gerson to Flamengo 4m The previous season was boosted by the big money sales of Alisson Manolas Pellegrini and Strootman
In fact ASRoma 204m loss is the second highest ever reported in Italy only surpassed by Inter s 207m in 2006 07 It is also the third highest ever in Europe also behind MCFC 2010 11 218m loss
Most Italian clubs have reported large losses in 2019 20 due to impact of the pandemic but ASRoma 204m post tax loss is the worst in Serie A ahead of Milan 195m Inter 100m and Juventus 90m Note many clubs have 31 December year end so accounts do not reflect COVID
ASRoma lowered wage bill 29m 16 from 184m to 155m while other expenses were cut 11m 12 to 84m However there were increases in player amortisation up 11m 13 to 94m depreciation up 6m to 10m and net interest payable up 4m to 32m
ASRoma revenue reduction was mainly TV down 59m 41 to 86m partly due to playing in Europa League instead of Champions League prior year though also falls in commercial down 20m 36 to 35m and match day down 13m 39 to 21m Player loans up 4m to 7m
ASRoma loss before tax shot up from 15m to 204m their highest ever loss as revenue fell 87m 37 from 236m to 149m and profit on player sales slumped 111m to 18m only partly offset by 24m 6 reduction in operating expenses After tax loss was also 204m
ASRoma 2019 20 accounts cover a season when they finished 5th in Serie A and reached the last 16 of the Europa League Impacted by COVID 19 in the last 3 months After year end The Friedkin Group purchased the club from fellow American James Pallotta Some thoughts follow
In 2019 20 Hull City managed to post a pre tax profit of around 3m despite COVID impact mainly due to profit on player sales rising 18m to 23m Revenue fell 32m 67 from 48m to 16m as parachute payments stopped Partly compensated by expenses being cut by 14m hcafc
Atalanta accounts cover 2019 calendar year i e pre COVID Profit before tax increased from 35m to 40m 27m after tax as revenue surged 42m 43 to 141m largely due to Champions League and profit on player sales rose 14m to 38m Wages up from 50m to 69m
In 2019 20 Lazio loss before tax widened from 4m to 15m 16m after tax as revenue fell 18m 14 from 124m to 106m no shirt sponsor and profit on player sales decreased 9m to 17m offset by 15m cut in operating expenses
In 2019 20 Borussia Dortmund went from 22m profit before tax to 47m loss 44m after tax as profit on player sales fell 43m to 40m Despite COVID restrictions revenue was basically flat at 379m but operating expenses rose 25m and net interest was 2m higher BVB
In 2019 20 Juventus loss before tax widened from 27m to 82m 90m after tax as revenue fell 88m 18 from 494m to 407m partly offset by wages being cut 43m 13 from 328m to 284m and profit on player sales rising 40m to 167m Non cash expenses up 48m
In 2019 20 Manchester United swung from 27m profit before tax to 21m loss a deterioration of 48m Revenue dropped 118m 19 from 627m to 509m while profit on player sales fell 7m to 18m partly offset by 81m 13 reduction in operating expenses MUFC
As mentioned yesterday I have prepared a few of the two page executive summaries for some of the football clubs that have already published accounts for the 2019 20 season Going forward I ll aim to include this as an add on to the traditional detailed financial review
If people would be interested in the executive summary for the other clubs that have published 2019 20 accounts namely MUFC Juventus BVB and hcafc let me know and I ll prepare them tomorrow
Final call for today s thread on Ajax s 2019 20 accounts when the impact of less progress in the Champions League and COVID meant a 37m reduction in revenue though they still made a 27m pre tax profit thanks to high player sales Ajax
I appreciate that today s Ajax thread was a bit of an epic so here s a handy executive summary for the TLDR brigade
Lunchtime reminder of today s thread on Ajax s 2019 20 accounts when the impact of less progress in the Champions League and COVID meant a 37m reduction in revenue though they still made a 27m pre tax profit thanks to high player sales Ajax
Thread on Ajax s 2019 20 accounts when the impact of less progress in the Champions League and COVID meant a 37m reduction in revenue though they still made a 27m pre tax profit thanks to high player sales Ajax
Ajax are a very well run club but their business model is very reliant on 2 factors a qualification for the Champions League b profitable player sales They clearly have the best financial resources in the Eredivisie but are still way behind their elite European rivals
Ajax have paid 3 1m in dividends in the last decade including 1 2m in both 2018 and 2020 They have announced that there will be no payment in 2021 due to the operating loss Also not allowed to pay dividend as club has received a COVID government grant
Ajax cash balance dropped 40m from 62m to 22m mainly due to 45m fall in cash generated from operating activities plus investment in new players 91m 20m more than previous season and payment of income taxes 14m Also 7m lease repayments and 1 2m dividend
In fairness Ajax total liabilities are still very low compared to other major European clubs Only Money League Top 20 club with a lower balance in 2018 19 than Ajax 1777m was Borussia Dortmund 145m while THFC MUFC and Barcelona have amassed over 1 2 bln liabilities
However it is worth keeping an eye on Ajax total liabilities the broadest possible definition of debt which have grown from 62m in 2016 to 280m in 2020 including a 103m increase last season alone though mainly due to the inclusion of finance leases per IFRS 16
Ajax transfer debt fell from 65m to 41m while amount owed to them by other clubs was also down from 63m to 44m giving net transfer receivables of 3m In 2018 19 their transfer debt was significantly lower than European clubs eg Barcelona 261m and Juventus 221m
Following the increase Ajax 151m debt is highest in the Eredivisie Only other clubs above 10m are PSV 32m Twente 21m Groningen 10m AZ 10m However they are a long way below other European clubs e g THFC 746m MUFC 580m Juventus 473m Inter 461m
Ajax had virtually zero financial debt though 2019 20 saw a technical increase for the inclusion of 151m financial lease obligations as a result of IFRS 16 Before that they enjoyed surplus net funds for many years
However on a gross basis Ajax have spent more than any other Dutch club on players over the last 5 seasons with their 224m twice as much as PSV 106m followed by Feyenoord 49m and AZ 26m In fact Ajax gross spend was equal to the rest of the league combined
Every single Eredivisie club has had net player sales over the last 5 seasons as another indicator of the financial position of Dutch football though Ajax have the highest figure by some distance with 277m well ahead of PSV 78m AZ 74m and Heerenveen 37m
Indeed four of Ajax five highest ever player sales have come in the last 2 years de Jong to Barcelona 86m de Ligt to Juventus 86m Ziyech to CFC 40m and van de Beek to MUFC 39m This is a hidden benefit of CL success Their top 25 transfers have generated 658m
Ajax have been a selling club for many years as their financial constraints make it virtually impossible to keep players In fact in the last 5 years average annual net sales have increased to 55m though this disguises purchases increasing to 45m with sales up to 100m
Ajax player amortisation of 53m is easily the highest in the Eredivisie ahead of PSV 22m and Feyenoord 15m then a big drop to AZ 6m However to place this into perspective big spending clubs like CFC Juventus and Barcelona have more than 140m
Ajax player amortisation i e the annual charge to write down transfer fees has risen considerably over the last few seasons reflecting their growing investment in the playing squad It has more than quintupled from 9m in 2014 to 53m in 2020 including 14m last year
In 2018 19 Ajax 46 wages to turnover ratio was only bettered among the top 20 Money League clubs by Schalke 04 38 and Tottenham 39 It was much lower than the likes of Roma 78 Juventus 66 Atletico Madrid 63 Napoli 62 Lyon 59 and Barcelona 59
Following the decrease in revenue Ajax wages to turnover ratio rose from 46 to 57 around the same as 2018 This was better than PSV 66 but worse than Feyenoord 49 though their ratio may well be worse when 2019 20 accounts are published
However for Ajax it is a case of being a big fish in a small pond as their 92m wage bill is significantly lower than the top clubs in the major leagues e g less than 20 of Barcelona 501m This makes it fairly inevitable that their young stars will move abroad
The Ajax wage bill of 92m is by some distance the highest in the Eredivisie around twice as much as the closest challenger PSV Eindhoven 47m followed by Feyenoord 35m There is then a further big gap to AZ 22m Vitesse 19m and Twente 15m
Ajax wage bill was flat at 92m as 16m increase in player salaries was offset by 16m decrease in performance related bonuses due to less progress in the Champions League Since 2018 revenue 77 and wages 75 have grown at the same rate
Ajax have extended their two main sponsorship deals a shirt sponsor Ziggo a telecoms provider to June 2024 worth around 9m a year b kit supplier Adidas who have been with the club since 2000 have a new 6 year deal worth around 8m a year until June 2025
Ajax 65m commercial revenue is the highest in the Eredivisie well ahead of Feyenoord 45m and PSV 40m However it is less than a fifth of the elite European clubs such as Barcelona 384m PSG 363m and Bayern Munich 357m
Ajax commercial income grew 5m 8 from 60m to 65m including sponsorship 35m merchandising 19m down 2m due to late launch of shirt and closure of fan shops due to virus and 9m other income government COVID subsidy and donations from season ticket holders
Ajax average attendance of 52 300 remains the highest in the Eredivisie around 11 000 more than Feyenoord 42 200 The only other Dutch clubs above 20 000 were PSV Eindhoven with 33 600 and Twente Enschede 27 200 Ajax 45 448 season tickets were 2 204 more than prior year
Ajax match day income fell 9m 18 from 51m to 42m largely due to 9 fewer games including 4 in Europe down 7m and 4 in the Eredivisie season ending early Much higher than other Eredivisie clubs with the closest being Feyenoord 17m and PSV 14m
The importance of Champions League qualification for Ajax cannot be overstated Including 10m gate receipts they earned 56m which was around a third of their total revenue The 41m fall over prior season s amazing 97m is the main reason for the club s revenue decrease
Ajax have earned a chunky 152m from European competition in the last 5 years which is even more impressive considering they did not reach the group stage of Champions League or Europa League in 2017 18 Next highest for Dutch clubs PSV 94m and Feyenoord 30m
Ajax benefited from a new UEFA coefficient payment based on performances over 10 years where they were ranked 14th in the Champions League thus receiving 21m This distribution methodology rewards the club s good record in Europe
Based on my estimate Ajax earned 48m from Europe in 2019 20 47m from the Champions League group stage plus another 1m after dropping down to the Europa League Much lower than 79m earned the previous season when they reached the Champions League semi final
For some perspective the club finishing top of the Premier League received around 170m while the bottom club got 110m i e 12 times as much as Ajax 9m They only get slightly more than an English Championship club not benefitting from parachute payments
Ajax receive less than 10m a season TV money from the Eredivisie who signed a 12 year deal with Fox that started in the 2013 14 season The distribution is based on a club s historical performance results over the previous 10 years so Ajax get the most
To reinforce the enormous revenue disparity for Dutch clubs the Eredivisie had 594m revenue in 2018 19 just 10 of the Premier League 5 9 bln Also miles behind Spain 3 4 bln Germany 3 3 bln Italy 2 5 bln France 1 9 bln Also below Russia 752m Turkey 748m
In fact even after doubling revenue to 199m in 2018 19 the gap between Ajax and the top club was almost unchanged with Barcelona growing to an incredible 841m Overmars again It s like being in Formula 1 and driving a DAF It s hard to pass the Mercedes and Ferraris
Based on 018 19 revenue of 199m Ajax were 23rd in the Deloitte Money League ahead of Benfica Wolves and Valencia This is a fine achievement though worth noting this is still far below the elite overseas clubs with the top nine all earning more than half a billion Euros
The gap between Ajax and their two main domestic rivals was only higher last season but is still 91m for PSV and Feyenoord who have less than half the revenue of the Amsterdam club Supports director Marc Overmars view We need to become the Bayern Munich of our league
As a consequence Ajax 162m revenue is not only the highest in the Eredivisie by far but also more than the next two clubs combined PSV 72m and Feyenoord 71m Looked at another way it s also around the same revenue as the lowest 13 clubs combined
Although Ajax revenue fell 37m their 2019 20 revenue of 162m was still their second highest ever 69m more than 93m two years ago The growth over 2018 was driven by European TV revenue 44m but also healthy increases in commercial 16m and match day 11m
Ajax usually post operating losses offset by player sales but this slumped from 4m to 56m in 2019 20 the worst in Eredivisie though PSV also dropped to 41m Only 2 clubs had profits RKC Waalwijk 4m Emmen 1m In 18 19 Ajax 4m loss was one of lowest in Europe
Almost all the Eredivisie clubs have negative or very low positive EBITDA so Ajax 8m is still the highest in the league even after the decrease in 2019 20 The next highest are RKC Waalwijk 5m Feyenoord 2m and Twente 2m
Ajax EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Depreciation and Amortisation which strips out player sales and non cash items to give underlying profitability fell from 38m to 8m more in line with usual levels down from 111m to 93m if player sales are included
Ajax are very reliant on player sales to make a profit earning a thumping great 400m from this activity in the last 10 years averaging 69m a season since 2017 Next year s accounts will include Hakim Ziyech to CFC Donny van de Beek to MUFC and Sergio Dest to Barcelona
Ajax have a sustainable business model reporting profits in 9 of the last 10 years only loss was 1m in 2015 16 In that period they have accumulated over a quarter of a billion Euros profit averaging 26m a season However they do expect a loss in 2020 21 due to COVID
Ajax are known for their strategy of developing and selling players with 2019 20 benefiting from 84m profit from this activity 12m up on prior season mainly Matthijs de Ligt to Juventus and Kasper Dolberg to Nice Next highest profits in Eredivisie PSV 47m and AZ 13m
Furthermore many clubs have announced huge losses for 2019 20 due to COVID including Roma 204m Milan 195m Barcelona 97m Juventus 90m Dortmund 44m Ajax and Benfica profits were due to high player sales In 2018 19 Ajax had one of the highest profits in Europe
Despite the fall Ajax 27m profit is still the highest in the Eredivisie well ahead of the next highest AZ 8m As a rule very few Dutch clubs make big money so Ajax 69m surplus in 2018 19 was something special and unlikely to be repeated
Ajax wage bill was flat at 92m while other expenses including match costs fell 8m 11 to 62m However player amortisation leapt up 14m 36 from 39m to 53m Due to IFRS 16 reclass from rental depreciation and interest payable rose 8m and 2m respectively
Ajax 42m revenue fall was largely due to less progress in the Champions League and pandemic impact As a result broadcasting dropped 33m 37 from 89m to 56m while match day was down 9m 18 from 51m to 42m Commercial increased 5m 8 from 60m to 65m
Ajax profit before tax fell 42m from 69m to 27m profit after tax down from 52m 20m largely due to revenue dropping 37m 16 from a record 199m to 162m and expenses increasing by 17m to 220m partly offset by profit on player sales rising 12m to 84m
Ajax 2019 20 accounts cover a season when the Eredivisie was ended early in April due to COVID 19 The KNVB decided to maintain league positions with Ajax leading but no title was awarded Eliminated at Champions League group stage Some thoughts in the following thread

Ed Woodward warned We expect the COVID impact to remain visible for quiet some time to come though MUFC do have access to an additional 150m revolving credit facility which provides flexibility to support the club through the disruption
Seven Premier League clubs benefited from more than 100m funding from their owners in the 5 years up to 2019 with CFC leading the way with 440m followed by EFC 299m and AVFC 193m On the other hand MUFC paid 89m dividends to their owners
Despite the financial challenges MUFC have still found enough cash to pay their shareholders mainly the Glazers a full dividend of 23m United were the only Premier League club to pay a dividend in 2018 19 and have paid 112m in the last 5 years
MUFC would have had even more money to spend if they did not have to bear the cost of the Glazers leveraged buy out In fact since the takeover they have spent over 1 bln on financing 704m interest 234m debt repayments and 125m dividends Averaged 42m in last 5 years
Since 2010 MUFC have generated nearly 2 bln of cash 1 6 bln operating activities plus 300m from shares plus 130m from cash balance Around 1 bln has been spent on players but almost the same has gone on financing Another 141m on infrastructure and 26m on tax
As a result MUFC cash balance slumped by 256m including 7m forex gain from 308m to 52m This is below 2018 19 cash at AFC 167m MCFC 130m and THFC 123m though you would expect these to be much lower in COVID impacted 2019 20 accounts
MUFC only generated 18m cash from operations compared to average 200m in last 5 years Spent net 192m on players purchases 221m sales 29m 21m infrastructure 23m dividends 19m interest 21m on shares All that resulted in a 263m net cash outflow
Although it has fallen from its peak MUFC annual interest payment of 20m is a lot more than every other Premier League club except THFC where stadium debt has recently increased their interest to 26m More relevantly MCFC and LFC only pay 4m and 2m respectively
MUFC 149m transfer debt is second highest in the Premier League just behind LFC 167m In 2018 19 their 188m was the third highest in Europe only behind Barcelona 230m and Juventus 195m
MUFC transfer payables fell from 188m to 149m having been as high as 258m two years ago as stage payments on transfer fees were paid Transfer receivables up from 18m to 58m so net transfer debt was down from 169m to 91m
Even after all the Glazers refinancings MUFC still owe more than half a billion pounds only behind THFC 658m new stadium Note CFC have 1 5 bln debt in their holding company United also 2nd highest debt in Europe above Juventus 417m Inter 407m and Barcelona 240m
MUFC net debt more than doubled from 204m to 474m mainly due to 256m fall in cash from 308m to 52m deferred sponsor payments 80m 20 21 season ticket money 50m player spend up 56m Gross debt in GBP terms rose 15m from 511m to 526m though USD debt was unchanged
MUFC only spent around 75m this summer mainly van de Beek Diallo and Telles with the club explaining that the transfer window was never going to be business as usual as it should be cautious while impacted by COVID to maintain its financial strength
In cash terms MUFC have averaged 144m net spend in last 4 years purchases 187m sales 43m compared to 98m in preceding 2 years and 55m in 3 years before that This included 221m player purchases in 2019 20 mainly Maguire Fernandes Wan Bissaka and James
MUFC player purchases in 2018 19 of 183m were 80m more than the prior season However still lower than CFC 281m and LFC 223m in 2018 19 That said United have spent a hefty 735m on new players in the last 4 years and 1 2 bln in the last 7 years
As a result of this decrease MUFC player amortisation of 123m is now a fair way below CFC 168m and just behind MCFC 127m followed by LFC 112m EFC 95m and AFC 90m In Europe United were also outpaced in 2018 19 by Juventus 131m and Barcelona 128m
MUFC player amortisation the annual charge to expense transfer fees over the length of a player s contract fell 3m 2 from 126m to 123m down 14m from the 137m peak two years ago
We will have to wait for another MUFC company to publish its accounts before we know Ed Woodward s 2019 20 salary but United fans will be delighted to see that he trousered 3 2m in 2018 19 only below Daniel Levy s 7m in the Premier League including 3m new stadium bonus
MUFC wages to turnover ratio increased from 53 to 56 the highest it has been for many years it was only 45 3 years ago However it is still one of the lowest in the Premier League Last year it was also one of the best in Europe about the same as Bayern Munich
MUFC 332m wage bill in 2018 19 was highest ever reported in Premier League but 284m in 2019 20 has fallen below MCFC 315m LFC 310m and CFC 286m though picture may well be different with 2019 20 accounts Last year United only behind Barcelona wages 442m in Europe
MUFC wage bill fell 48m 15 from 332m to 284m mainly as a result of player sales loan deals and lower bonuses from not playing in Champions League This is United s lowest since 264m in 2017
As some games were played without fans MUFC average attendance fell from 74 500 to 57 400 though it was once again the highest in the Premier League around 10 000 more than AFC Season ticket prices have been frozen for nine consecutive years
Despite this decrease MUFC 90m match day income is likely to still be the highest in the Premier League AFC 2018 19 revenue of 96m will fall in 2019 20 due to COVID though THFC figure will be interesting after a full season at their new stadium
MUFC match day income fell 21m 19 from 111m to 90m as revenue for 4 home games 3 Premier League 1 Europa League that were played after 30th June was deferred into 2020 21 accounts while 1 game in 2019 20 accounts was played behind closed doors
MUFC relatively poor performance in Europe including not even qualifying in 2015 means that they have only earned 248m in the last 5 years That s not too shabby but it is a hefty 142m less than MCFC 390m Also below LFC 310m THFC 299m and CFC 262m
In 2018 19 MUFC benefited from a new UEFA coefficient payment based on performances over 10 years as they received 31m for this element the 5th highest in the Champions League but this was much lower in the Europa League in 2019 20 only around 3 4m
MUFC earned 25m from Europa League for reaching semi finals much less than prior season s 83m Champions League quarter finals but only booked 17m in 19 20 as revenue from knock out stages will be in 20 21 accounts This is before 16 COVID rebate spread over 5 years
Premier League has not published TV money details but EPL Handbook has illustrative example based on league place suggesting gross revenue rose from 143m to 151m new 19 20 deal less 16m rebate 14m per MUFC accounts giving net 135m Some income deferred to 2020 21
TV money has driven MUFC revenue growth in recent years but plunged 101m 42 from 241m to 140m domestic 115m Europe 17m MUTV 8m due to revenue from 10 Premier League games slipping to 2020 21 accounts plus 14m rebate to broadcasters and no Champions League
MUFC Chevrolet shirt sponsorship is 64m a season extended 6 months to December 2021 while Adidas kit deal is an amazing 75m cut by 30 if fail to reach Champions League for 2 consecutive seasons Aon pay 15m for training kit facilities Kohler 10m for sleeve sponsor
That said MUFC 279m commercial income is still over 50m higher than MCFC 227m The fact that so much of United s revenue is from commercial 44 in 2018 19 gives them a degree of protection from the financial impact of the pandemic that others don t enjoy
MUFC commercial income rose 4m 1 to 279m as sponsorship increased 10m to 183m though retail fell 6m to 96m as Old Trafford Megastore was closed for 3 months However this revenue stream has been essentially flat for the last 5 years while big growth at rival clubs
Based on 2018 19 figures MUFC 627m revenue was third highest in the Deloitte Money League but a fair way below Barcelona 741m and Real Madrid 667m Other leading clubs have seen similar revenue falls to United s 118m in 2019 20 e g Barcelona 102m Juventus 77m
Following this decrease MUFC revenue is no longer the highest in England falling below MCFC 535m and LFC 533m though these clubs have yet to publish COVID impacted accounts for 2019 20 That said other leading clubs have been narrowing the gap to United
MUFC 509m revenue is the lowest they have generated for five years 395m in 2015 and is now back to 2016 levels 515m in 2016 Before the pandemic struck the club had projected 560 580m which implies that the COVID 19 impact was 50 70m
At an operating level excluding player sales and interest MUFC made a 13m loss the first time they have not posted a profit since 2006 In fairness very few Premier League clubs were profitable here in 18 19 while United s 24m profit that year was 2nd highest in Europe
However MUFC lower EBITDA of 132m is still second highest in the Premier League underlining the club s incredible ability to generate cash THFC are the only club above them with 168m but that will fall in 2019 20 For some context 8 clubs had EBITDA below 25m
MUFC EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortisation considered a proxy for cash operating profit as it strips out player sales and exceptional items decreased from 186m to 132m the lowest for 5 years and a fair way below the 200m peak in 2017
MUFC 2019 20 results were not impacted by exceptional items whereas previous year was hit by 20m compensation paid for a managerial change 15m to Jose Mourinho with the remainder to his coaching staff That makes 36m in manager pay offs since Sir Alex Ferguson retired
MUFC results have rarely been boosted by player sales only averaging 12m over the last decade In the 5 years up to 2019 United s 69m profit from this activity was significantly lower than rest of the Big Six CFC 332m LFC 306m THFC 172m AFC 170m and MCFC 147m
This is the first loss that MUFC have reported since 2015 when their small 4m deficit was due to the lack of European football Before 2020 United had aggregated an impressive 159m profit in the last four years averaging 40m annually in that period
The MUFC strategy has not been overly reliant on player sales so their 18m profit from this activity is mid table in the Premier League Fell 7m from prior season Included lucrative sale of Lukaku to Inter but profit restricted due to high book value in United s accounts
Furthermore MUFC 23m loss after tax is much smaller than many announced by European counterparts for 2019 20 e g Roma 184m Milan 176m Barcelona 87m and Juventus 81m That said Real Madrid broke even while Benfica and Ajax made good profits due to high player sales
MUFC 21m loss before tax would have been in the bottom half of the Premier League in 2018 19 though all clubs are likely to see a reduction in profitability in 2019 20 due to impact of the pandemic EFC and CFC losses over 100m even before COVID
MUFC wages and other expenses both fell 15 by 48m from 332m to 284m and 16m from 109m to 93m respectively 20m exceptional costs in 18 19 for Mourinho s exit Depreciation rose 6m to 19m due to property impairment while interest was up 4m to 26m forex losses
The main driver of MUFC revenue reduction is broadcasting down 101m 42 to 140m partly due to competing in Europa League instead of Champions League the previous season while match day also fell 21m 19 to 90m Commercial actually rose slightly to 279m
MUFC swung from 27m profit before tax to 21m loss a deterioration of 48m Revenue dropped 118m 19 from 627m to 509m while profit on player sales fell 7m to 18m partly offset by 81m 13 reduction in operating expenses from 603m to 522m After tax loss was 23m
Manchester United are the first Premier League club to publish accounts for the 2019 20 season when they finished 3rd in the league and reached the semi finals of 3 cup competitions including Europa League Impacted by COVID 19 in last 3 months Some thoughts follow MUFC

Thread on Hull City s 2019 20 accounts a season when they still posted a profit despite the impact of COVID 19 helped by high player sales but were relegated to League One hcafc
After initially saving the club from going bust the Allams have managed a steady decline going from Premier League to League One in the past 4 years Although their finances look better than most in the basket case that is the Championship the lack of investment has cost them
Like all other football clubs COVID 19 has impacted hcafc finances so they asked their players to take a 20 pay cut though it has been reported that this was rejected and furloughed some other staff
The Allam family has been looking to sell hcafc since 2014 They have made it clear that they want to recoup the money they have invested so would need at least 42m i e the current level of debt As Allam said The lower the loan the lower the asking price
hcafc have no FFP concerns as they are profitable over the 3 year monitoring period As Allam noted with a fair bit of understatement We have the biggest amount of head room in terms of financial fair play more than any other club in the division
In the last decade I estimate that the Allams have received 36m from the club 22m interest on their loans plus 14m dividends and 2m directors fees The latter two payments are made from the parent company but driven by profits made by the football club and exclude 2020
Since the Allams bought hcafc they have put in 57m net of loan repayments while 23m has come from asset sales and 7m from operations Most 37m has gone on net player purchases then 24m interest 16m bank loan repayments and 6m tax Only 4m invested in infrastructure
As a result hcafc cash balance dropped from 9 7m to just 0 2m which was the second lowest in the Championship In fairness 15 clubs in this division had less than 2m cash in the bank so this was not exceptional though not a great buffer in the current climate
hcafc 22m cash shortfall from operations partly due to a steep rise in debtors was compensated by 22m net player sales However the club then paid 9m to the Allams 8m loan repayment and 1m interest leading to a 10m net cash outflow
hcafc only have 0 6m transfer debt while they are owed 11 7m from other clubs giving a net receivable of 11 1m This has been the position in four of the last five years due to the slowdown in player purchases and increase in sales
Although debt is high in the Championship most of it is provided by owners who charge little or no interest However hcafc are an exception to the rule as their 1 7m interest at a reported 4 was the highest in the division though down from 2 4m the previous year

Glenn Murray and Troy Deeney are in a relegation scrap If they don t want to play I understand it Don t play then Stay at home There will be a lot of young players at Brighton Watford desperate for an opportunity and who will fight to save their respective clubs

Another hour in the bank Ready to return to action Hopefully soon Kaizen
In my opinion the only players clubs who don t want to go back are the ones with either a relegation battle they want to avoid or nothing to play for Every competitor wants to compete Players have trained admirably through these crazy times they deserve at least a shot
Fans are a massive part of the journey as well We need to get them into stadiums ASAP but only when it s safe Our players and staff are ready to get back and finish the season we started in August Let s crack on
I couldn t agree more As soon as it s safe we should complete the campaign Surely nobody wants to be given a promotion You have to go and win it Or it is meaningless

Well worth a watch if you like your football
Not my game that lying about running times Good to see somebody holding the bluffers to account
Any many other managers beating that
Good insight for the football fans wondering what this pandemic will do to football clubs and businesses
Tremendous nights work Fans were incredible
We can t just ignore those numbers and believe it was handled correctly in this country That is over 10 000 human beings no longer breathing because of horrendous leadership Not acceptable Shouldn t be papered over
Well done mate
When you read it in chronological order it can only be described as a National Scandal How did Cheltenham and Liverpool vs Atletico in UCL go ahead Well worth a read
Brilliant Fino Well done mate
He has self isolated at home He was never checked once at any airport That was the point I was making People are freely moving around while we are on lockdown Makes no sense
He did His university campus closed down That meant he was without accommodation
Hard when thousands of people are dying daily Gary Not easy to forget and gloss over that in a positive way
He s a university student Everyone got forced to leave the campus Had no choice
They took it seriously It saved countless lives The people that got elected here didn t Now people are dying because of it Almost a 1000 people a day People s mothers and fathers Brothers and sisters sons and daughters Loved ones Not acceptable
My cousin flew back from USA last week The UK was on lockdown He flew Tulsa to Chicago Chicago to Washington DC Washington DC to Heathrow and he was never checked once at any point for CV How is that good governance Surely you knew it was serious then
Very easy to say that if you haven t lost somebody you love Ronald Be thankfully
New Zealand government have handled it correctly and should rightfully be applauded Our current government has handled this really really poorly They shouldn t be allowed to brush this off Too many have lost their lives unnecessarily because of their decisions
Inspired by all the people having a go at different distances recently Stay healthy
Some people We are volunteering to help vulnerable people out in a time of crisis Why do you have a problem with that
Just trying to help mate

What is wrong with the fella Al
Brilliantly done
Well earned Enjoy the gig
For those amongst us staying in tonight
Frontline workers still not given the correct PPE and don t have everything they need to protect themselves and save lives How is this possible
The political class in this country should have to answer some serious questions when this nightmare has finished Not good enough
Thousands of people dying unnecessarily due to this illness Lack of proper preventative planning disinformation and years of austerity combine to wreak havoc on our vital social structures We only have ourselves to blame as we allowed this to happen Stay Safe
Is it true that MP s are being given an extra 10 000 working from home allowance
If this graphic is correct I m baffled as to why anyone in our current government is patting themselves or their colleagues on the back Handled horrendously from the very outbreak Stay in FFS

Get the frontline people tests and the correct protection that they need They are putting their lives on the line Clapping Celebs holding up signs Kicking fucking toilet rolls It might make you feel better but it won t save lives Say less do more
No point clapping outside at 8pm unless you make your local politician accountable Say less do more A chance to use your influence to help for next century Stay safe and look after everyone you can
This is all our fault We have allowed successive governments to cost cut and streamline our services For decades vital public sector areas have been underfunded and taken for granted This is not a time for scapegoats This is a time for wide scale reforms
Does anyone have the data for how much Tax and National insurance the clubs and employees contribute to our country every year
NHS workers have been under resourced over worked and under payed for decades WE haven t held the people WE voted in accountable for far too long Money wasted on stupid wars and vanity projects
It s only when the tide goes out that you see who has been swimming naked Ironically it s a Warren Buffet quote We have taken our NHS and public service industries for granted for far too long We need a long term strategy and told hold elected people accountable
Herd Immunity Boris and his cronies NHS under funded and mismanaged for decades That ll be the Premier League footballers fault Wake up This is about shifting the focus away from the government handling this pandemic horrendously

Well done Molinari champion Congratulations to all the team
Great to see you again Chris Looking forward to the season ahead
Russia have staged a great tournament btw Hats off to em
Is this the football Gods now crying on the trophy presentation due to that VAR decision
That VAR decision killed the Croatians momentum Really feel for them Very harsh France clinical on the counter but the better side lost for me Sometimes It s better to be lucky than good
If that s given against Norway in a WC final would you say exactly the same thing
But it flicked of Balaise Mutuidi s Head a yard in front of him and deviated Impossible to get his hand out of the way It has to be clear and obvious It s not about the ball just hitting the hand
If the ref decides in real time it s not a pen That should be that Nobody in the ear If he s unsure he should be allowed to check We don t need 5 people in a studio somewhere else Just copy both codes of Rugby It works
When used correctly VAR can enhance the game No doubt Just feel its way to inconsistent at this moment Even the replays the ref watches are poor
No way the player has time to react and think I m moving my hand towards that to knock it out of play It happens too quickly and just hits his hand for me No way a pen
If you think that s a pen you re either French or you ve never played football Could ruin a great game that How is Perisic meant to get out of the way of that Hope that s not the key moment
I mean how is that a pen How can he get his hand out of the way Shambles
What a start Croatia deservedly level WorldCup18
What a story it would be for Croatia to lift the World Cup Formed in 1991 and a population of 4m What players they ve had in a short space of time Boban Suker Prosinecki Boksic and of course Modric France clear favourite but I d like to get one They re a team
We need to learn our lessons from the tournament and come back stronger No nearer to winning a major tournament but won hearts and minds and now must build on that
Training methods clearly wrong Watt bike sessions between games in a tournament Croatia had played ET for 3rd straight match against Eng we looked legged and severely fatigued during ET
In my opinion a better manager could have won the competition 6 defensive players on the pitch far too often Especially when 2 1 down in WC semi final Also 0 10 outfield players left footed Team lacked balance
Stand by my Southgate comments when he was appointed Lovely guy Comes out of the tournament with a fantastic respect He s won hearts and minds
Don t let that mask the fact they ve played 4 decent teams They ve lost 3 times Belgium x2 and Croatia and drawn the other Winning on penalties against Colombia in fact we ve beaten Tunisia Panama and Sweden Let s not get carried away just yet
The World Cup has been a fantastic PR campaign for England football team They ve reconnected with supporters that have in recent years felt alienated from the team
Remember the greatest failure is not to try Well done lads Safe trip home
Proud of the lads Gave us great entertainment all summer They come back with a lot more respect than they went Will we ever get a better chance
Come on the boys
