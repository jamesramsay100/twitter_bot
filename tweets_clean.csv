Now the game has finished I can have a good look round Anfield to bring back the memories Hopefully I ll find my statue at some point
It may have been 5 years since I left but nothing has changed I can still deliver 3 points for Liverpool at Anfield
It s tough going into a game as an underdog but I m sure Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool will cope
Whilst the comparisons between Guardiola and myself have been nice over the years I think its time they stopped Pep has tried hard but unfortunately he will never be at my level and it s unkind to give him an unreachable target
Misses the game against us My Liverpool voodoo doll is working wonders

Me What a bad result to lose 3 0 to West Ham today It has to be the shock of the weekend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Don t worry Brendan I ve got this Jurgen Klopp Good effort Ole but hold my beer
Can Jurgen Klopp stop breaking records He s just ruined my worst ever result at Liverpool
Deluded Brendan is typing
Brb just resetting the Premier League s servers
I still can t believe I jokingly said to Ed Woodward give us 78m for Harry Maguire and he said yes
Thanks for this Takes the heat off my bad result you truly are team players
If I m honest I wasn t particularly happy playing West Ham without David Moyes For me the game should be replayed when he s back
If you take the second half in isolation against West Ham then we actually only lost 1 0 That for me is a fantastic result against one of the best teams in the league Our progress is there for all to see

If Harvey Barnes was Brazilian and called Barnesinho the whole world would he raving about him He s one of the best wingers I ve ever managed I can t wait to see him tearing the likes of Juventus and Barcelona apart next season in the Champions League

Brendan s thoughts of the day
45 points still up for grabs for us and 48 points for Liverpool They are 19 points ahead of us meaning if they lose 7 times and we win those 7 we have a chance to still catch them There s still a chance
A beautiful piece of 80 million defending from Harry Maguire there
Evra checking what Graeme Souness is drinking after his VAR rant is brilliant
Lots of Leicester fans tweeting me saying how we missed Wilfred Ndidi in our last two games We just need a strong talented passionate and hard working central midfielder to cover for him Joe Allen The time has come
I think I ll be having words with Rebekah Vardy with regards to Jamie and the night shift with their new baby Goals before the birth 17 Goals since the birth 0
Also I m not saying I m giving up on winning the Premier League but losing today has severely hampered our chances
If you ask any manager in the country they ll say that Turf Moor is by far one of the hardest away ground to go to So to only lose 2 1 to Burnley is actually a great result
The important thing is not to stop questioning Curiosity has its own reason for existence One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity of life of the marvelous structure of reality

I owe this goal to Brendan Rodgers he taught me how to be the best Luis Suarez
Great character shown there Now if you want a real challenge
Great performance from Agent Maguire today Another genius move from me to send him to derail a potential title challenger
That Manchester Derby result means only one thing It is now in my hands to stop Liverpool winning the title I ve done it once before and I aim to do it again Sir Brendan Rodgers The Scouse Slayer
The links to Arsenal were flattering however I have aspirations to win the Treble next season and that will only be possible with Leicester City Lionel Messi can enjoy his European dominance this year as it s coming to an end next season when Jamie Vardinho is unleashed
Delighted to sign a new Leicester City contract after only 9 months at the club Jamie Vardy James Maddison and Youri Tielemans are arguably the best players I ve ever managed I d go as far as saying they are better than Luis Suarez Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho
I can clarify that I am having contract talks with Leicester City today amid the interest from Arsenal I have a few demands I m hoping they ll meet Joe Allen a new car and a lifetime supply of Walkers crisps being just a few of them

As good as Lionel Messi s achievement of winning 6 Ballon d ors is has he ever scored 31 goals for Fleetwood in the Conference Premier No Jamie Vardy has
I can neither confirm nor deny this whilst not making comment on not commenting

I just said to Marco Silva in the tunnel Hey cheer up at least people can call you Marco Sil Var now I don t think he saw the funny side
I m not one to take too much credit for my teams success but I think it s safe to say bringing Kelechi Iheanacho was a master stroke No wonder I m regarded as one of the best managers in the world
I ve always said VAR is the best thing to ever happen to the Premier League What a beautiful piece of technology
Spent most of half time calming Jamie Vardy down about VAR He was screaming The only thing that should ever be 3 letters is WKD
So after today s results it s clear it s now a two horse in the Premier League I ve stopped Liverpool winning the title once before Can I do it again Only time will tell
Only one man can stop Liverpool now

Glad we put 9 past you now
Never forget
I ll tell the team to go easy
If they are holding out for me they ll be waiting a long time
Hi If you are now reversing VAR decisions could I ask you to review the Mane penalty against us last month and therefore add 1 point to our total and remove 2 from Liverpools Thanks Brendan

Just say you showed great character and it ll all go away Trust me
Jurgen Klopp can celebrate winning coach of the year all he wants but it ll never hide the fact I ve won 4 trophies he ll never get his hands on
I taught Trent Alexander Arnold how to hit a ball like that I remember back in 2015 spending hours on the training field with him I m so pleased to see him finally achieving his potential
People keep linking me to the Manchester United job but my response to them is why would I lower myself to a mid table mediocre team
When you get bored on FIFA and put the difficulty level to Amateur
Leicester City form 2019 2020 C H A R A C T E R
Told you I d be back See you at Anfield
I ve managed some of the best midfielders in the world in Steven Gerrard Scott Brown and Joe Allen but James Maddison may just be the best ever Have you ever seen him and Ronaldinho in the same room together I know I haven t What a player
VAR What a beautiful piece of technology
Harry Kane or Phil Jones
21st of September can only mean one thing 3 points against Spurs to go 2nd in the Premier League
Whilst it s obviously too early to know if Liverpool s Champions League last season was a fluke it s clear Jurgen Klopp is lacking consistency in Europe Something which I always achieved
Right so fucking NORWICH scored this goal and you re telling me Pep Guardiola isn t having an influence on English football
Good to see you today I m sorry you couldn t join us on the coach home despite you begging us to come back but rules are rules and unfortunately you are stuck with Man Utd till at least January
If games were won on possession we d have taken all 3 points today It s a huge positive to take that we a made more passes than Manchester United If you re going to lose then lose in the right way Tremendous stuff
If you only count goals scored from open play then we still remain unbeaten this season How long can this run last Only time will tell
What a superb performance from Roberto Firmino today Turning him from the wing back I signed into the world class striker he is today is one of my finest managerial achievements I hope Liverpool fans appreciate it
How many goals shall we put past Manchester United today
Funny way to spell Brendan Rodgers Damn autocorrect
Caption competiton
Looks like I was right to cash in on Harry Maguire when I did
Pep when he sees Sterling and Sancho linking up like a dream
I m a modest man but it s got to be me hasn t it
I m so good even number 1 wouldn t be enough for me
Not sure who made this list but I seem to be 8 places too low
Leicester City Premier League 2019 2020 Played 4 Won 2 Drawn 2 Lost 0 Points 8 Goals scored 6 Goals conceded 3 League position 3rd The Brendan Rodgers effect
Looking for Manchester United and Chelsea in the Premier League table like
Can someone please go and collect their dad from St Mary s
30 yes is a majority in my eyes
If I wrote a book on The Story Of Deluded Brendan would anyone be interested
This wouldn t happen if you stopped letting clowns take over football clubs
Congratulations Jamie at least this explains why you ve been tired in training recently
Great character this from Ben Stokes
Hi if you need a neck brace to look up at us in the table I d suggest going to local A E or GP Hope you re ok apart from that Brendan
What a superb victory that is to win 1 2 away at Sheffield United Bramhall lane is one of the hardest places to visit in the world so I m absolutely delighted To be in 3rd place and still unbeaten after 3 games is a top class start
Good luck at Bayern Coutinho It s unfortunate you couldn t join us but I just couldn t guarantee you the first team football you wanted It wouldn t be fair to have you as James Maddinsons understudy
2 games gone 2 games unbeaten Whilst I m not one to get carried away I ve been an invincible manager with Celtic before Could I do it with Leicester I don t see why not
You ok Andy
Anyone else remember when it was cool to follow accounts that you don t find funny No me neither
1 shot off target suggests we ve not been in it attacking wise but if you look at the bigger picture we ve only had 1 corner less than Chelsea so we are still massively in the game
But have they done it with the same style as it was done under me The answers no
New album dropping soon called Money for Maguire
When you wake up and realise Celtic got as far in the Champions League as Leicester did this season
A thrilling 0 0 draw Vs Wolves is a fantastic start to the season If we don t concede any goals in all our Premier League games then that s a minimum of 38 points which should see us safe from relegation
Always said it s an incredible piece of technology
City 4th You want the log in details for this account

Signing of the transfer window

Sorted what I m doing with the Harry Maguire money
Fake news this is photoshopped

Forgot to say add who you support to It kinda helps
Using a gif sum up your clubs transfer window so far
Maybe Leicester can show great character and get unsponsored by Paddy Power SaveOurShirt

This quote is actually nearly 2 years old
Just when you think as a company you can t sink any lower No wonder people despise you
Good morning How boring is the off season What are you all doing to keep entertained
Top 4 and Bottom 3 in the Premier League next season
Paddy Power have shown great character in doing this SaveOurShirt
I see they ve gone for Plan B after we rejected their move for Jamie Vardy
Meanwhile Huddersfield Town have now launched their away kit Guessing Paddy Power sold the advert spaces for this one
The names Rodgers Brendan Rodgers
When think they are sponsoring the Miss England event
Stop what you are doing Paddy Power s new sponsorship of Huddersfield Town has resulted in the worst kit of all time
A thug who managed to be able to play a bit of football
Harry Maguire
The powers that be have acted and you can no longer enjoy the wonders of this post
England s cricket world cup win yesterday is so much better with the music from Titanic
Change the title of a famous song to have Brendan Rodgers in it Go
Federer v Nadal is the equivalent of Me Vs Pep Guardiola next season Two of the best in the world going head to head fighting point for point It s now all down to a test of character
You ve obviously never seen me in training
Youri Tielemans knows
You think of players like Xavi Ronaldinho Zidane Pirlo and Joe Allen and you instantly think World Class That s the category for me Youri Tielemans falls into Imagine what you saw from him last year and times it by 10 That s how good I ll make him this season
RIP Bradley
You ok Ahmad
When I heard Ayoze Perez was available it was a no brainer Before Rafa left he told me he s the best player he s seen in a Newcastle shirt since Alan Shearer so we went all out for him For me now Top 4 is minimum
Roman Abramovich I have to admit I was devastated when I saw Brendan Rodgers left Celtic last season He was my number one choice to replace Sarri this Summer but Leicester City got there first It s a major setback but it just means Frank Lampard will have to do

Definitely having a wank with a pipe of Pringles tonight Might not even empty it out first
I woke up this morning and stared at my erection It was truly magnificent As pulsating as an Aphex Twin deep cut and as thick as a Kardashian s hoop I knew immediately that today was going to be a good day
Had to take a job at Argos to tide me over during the holiday season It s not even behind the tills I m one of those cunts fetching stuff from the stockroom My fucking headset doesn t even work Please buy my bastard book for someone this Christmas
Manchester United The time has come Whisper my name amongst the winds of change and I shall appear Purse your hungry desolate lips and suckle greedily upon my mighty weeping teat I do insist on keeping my own image rights mind That s non negotiable
I would like to announce I have decided to leave Everton Putting a fucking Angry Bird on the shirt was the last straw Fucking tinpot
I carry a prosthetic leg with me at all times For mystery purposes I don t tell the lads why I have it let them marinate in their own curiosity I just beat Wayne Rooney about the face and neck with it then put him in a tumble dryer Nobody swears at the Raj of Merseyside
He was Professor Hawking to the world of science but just little Ste to me I wrote about taking him to a discotheque for the first time in my book Twirling him around the dance floor like a delirious bin bag full of joy Goodnight sweet prince
Really can t be arsed with Everton tbh
That s super champ I said before ruffling his hair lifting him gently into my arms and putting him back into the ball pen outside my office He s earned it today His hair really is fucking appalling though
After I d finished reading Wazza put up his hand said Hi daddy my fave book is called The Detective Dog and it s about this dog that smells really good and he can smell anything and he goes to school and when all the school books go missing he uses his nose to find them
As a reward for yesterday s sensational performance I gave the lads some hot milk cookies let them lie down on the floor of my office and read them a chapter from my sensational new book which is available from Amazon at the low low price of 10 48
And as the grey sky rumbles on high and the liver bird roars below a figure emerges on the horizon He rides a steed of tactical aplomb and carries a shield of sheer bravado For he is Big Sam and he has Merseyside by the feisty little minge
I stand naked at the mouth of the river Mersey As the wicked winter winds whip my naked form my taut tadger waves to and fro conducting the river in some sort of primal orchestral manoeuvre A pigeon perches upon my mighty cock I smile Yeah I think I m ready for the Derby
They can get rid of that Z Cars muck for a start If I m walking out to music it ll be something fucking dope Something fucking REAL Bring Da Ruckus by Wu Tang Clan perhaps Or anything by Eagle Eye Cherry
Every murderous cloud has a silver lining folks Every fucking one of them
Richard Madeley though says my book is the funniest thing since Judy tried to get into the bath after 27 vodkas
The destruction wrought by Hurricane Irma is a sobering reminder of the truly wicked power of Mother Nature
Micheal Ball says he s VERY interested in playing Fritzl Fingers crossed In the meantime this is out tomorrow
A dog A cat What the fuck is that A pie A hat What the fuck is that A Ford Mondeo and a Vampire bat What The fuck IS THAAAATTTT
It s called What The Fuck is That and it s an absolute shot stopper of a cunt
It builds up to the final song which tackles the sensory overload experienced by the girls as they see the outside world for the 1st time
I m in such a rich vein of literary form at the moment Just finished writing my next project a musical based on the Josef Fritzl case
Nice review of my book from Simon Weston The whole thing crackles throughout he said Like my head Great guy
Do buy it though It s hard to make ends meet in retirement and Colin from The Money Shop is an unfeeling callous cunt
On 07 09 17 feast Feast on the very parchments of my wisdom Let the scratchings of my quill expand your mind
He followed this up licking a battery and saying haha it s all tingly innit but his point still stood
You ve done everything in football gaffer he continued It s time to conquer the literary world
Big Carlton Cole once said to me Great literature boss is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree
Some books have the power to change the world The power to educate The power to challenge
The first Adrian Mole
On The Origin of Species
Arsene Wenger will be yanking bits of my fingernails out of his fluffy French minge for weeks after that Fucking devastating
What a game It had absolutely everything I was squealing like a Japanese tourist Nobody gave them a chance but well played Stoke
Bested by Moysie Cunting Moysie It s like Professor Stephen Hawking making you tap out with a figure four leglock FML
Emerging The light The scream The air The thunder The life Glistening Breathing Wanting It s 2016 and Christ has been born again
Wearing nowt but a cape holding my plonker like a mic singing I Know It s Over by the Smiths into it I think this has all just hit me
It s Sammy Lee I feel sorry for He s just got Sky Q in for fuck sake
It s not me They can do anything with digital effects these days Look at that cunt Jar Jar Binks
Piece of fucking piss Like taking candy from Stephen Hawking that was The prick
Kurt Cobain was my friend And he knew I d be England manager one day
Tomorrow yields my coronation And ye shall follow me to the kingdom of glory And I m going to get so much bouncy fucking fanny on the way
I am a king For this I was born and for this I came into the world to testify to the truth I am the Messiah the Son of the living God
Christ David Gill s shitter can take a pounding I laid an egg like a chocolate caterpillar cake it sucked it down in one go Fair play
I promised myself I d secure Premier League safety before I took my fight to ISIS Now you shit haired cunts prepare to feel the blaze
Football on the telly a can of Dale s Pale Ale in my hand and eating orange Matchmakers out of the wife s arse Pressure What pressure
Big Sam teases the very anus of Dutch fear before plunging in the long cunning fingers of tactical bombardment
Any good contract lawyers in the Sunderland area ASAP lads yeah
Love watching this Man United side Thrilled by their new approach It s like watching myself make love which has always been a dream
The shrooms are starting to wear off Why the fuck am I in Sunderland
Slags of Merseyside and Wearside State your case and state it wisely For I am Big Sam and soon I may feast on your filth
Identity theft is a serious crime pal Prepare to feel my wrath
I m wearing Uggs on Sky right now Jamie is wearing Hi Tecs and Niall is in Primark brogues Big Sam out of the game No fucking chance
Once made love to Cilla on an empty Palladium stage That s a lorra lorra cock she squealed as Tarby watched on from the rafters RIP
Sexually Judy Murray is at her very best when she s in a bad mood Lucky is the man that feasts on her truculent flesh tonight
Anyway got a Skype job interview with Allied Dunbar tomorrow Need to find that fucking charger Haven t used the laptop since Y2K
The more I think of him the more I fucking hate Sepp Blatter I wish the rotten little Orc was dead
Then when Qatar got the World Cup Blatter told me he fingered a dusty Arabian whore with a boxing glove whilst laughing his head off
He also has a bumbag with It s not illegal if it s with your Sepp Daddy on it He s giddy for creepy name puns the little fucking goblin
Then again he had a notepad full of appalling jokes he d written with Blatter Patter on the cover in big letters A cunt truth be told

Thanks he replied before drawing a picture of Thatcher s minge on a wall outside a pub and screaming profanities at it Intense man

That creep Seb Coe actually asked my good buddy Simon Weston to carry the torch Insensitive bastard
My LED Lenser P7 has 200 lumens of focusable light and 130 hours of battery life from standard AAA s Now that s a torch to get hard over
Any adult who s impressed by a big fucking torch being carried by a dickhead really needs to have a word with themselves

I once dreamt I took part in a frankly incredible 69er with mother in a bath in Woking
Vividly dreaming about engaging in intercourse with family members is something that s haunted my slumber for many years now
I m loving this incognito mode Finally I can Google what does it mean if you dream about fucking a sibling without fear of reprisal
It s not even August yet and Big Sam has already made the move of the summer I ve went from iPhone to Android and I m bloody delighted

She looks a bit like a deranged German cyberterrorist but there s something about her I d like to explore
Sitting here slurping on a cool bottle of Chocolate Fudge Brownie Friji and contemplating whether I should seduce Andy Murray s mum
She is bloody lovely though Imagine loafing one into her over the net on Centre Court As Djokovic watches on Helpless Yet intrigued

I ll be caressing my cock later in the day without a care in the world and then a putrid ball of yellow terror will pop out of the folds
One drawback with long foreskin of course is the hideous pieces of bog roll left behind after I delictately dab my helmet after a piss
I don t care if it s arrogant I bloody love my genitalia I can stare at it for hours and still discover something new exciting about it
Fully extended it looks like one of Dhalsim s big bendy arms It has so much bloody character
Just looking at my tadger My foreskin really is incredibly long And stretchy I can pull it out a good three or four inches
Gutted by the result but what a performance from Pirlo He looks like a flamboyant yet intense concert pianist driven by a tragic past

Which leads me to believe lady mutts must have a cheeky clitoris tucked away somewhere Lovely cross from Gerrard for the goal tonight
As the hound was dragging its filthy ringpiece across the grass its eyes rolled skywards in what can only be described as orgasmic fervour
As I was out roller skating in the park yesterday I came across a dog taking a shit Upon further inspection I noticed it had a minge
Great result in the game tonight Proud to be an Englishman Do girl dog s have clits Been wondering about that all day
I stood by the phone for a full 13 minutes in the dark just imagining things It was 1994 He had those blonde highlights I m only human
I ll sling my tadger up your missus champ while buggering you senseless with my big old conk he said I put the phone down immediately
True story Andy Townsend once asked me and the wife to have a threesome with him A daisy chain fuckfest he promised

I d then stride awesomely around the pitch zapping dickheads in the crowd with my mystical blade I d start with those cunts in face paint
Strike me I d roar Strike me oh gods of thunder so that I may harness and use your electrical power for my own extraordinary ends
If I was there I d be standing slap bang in the centre circle with my magnificent Viking sword Trudy pointed high to the heavens
Shameful scenes in Donetsk To mince off the pitch due to a bit of drizzle and some lightning is frankly disgusting Big poofs
Tried to make some notes about potential transfer targets during this game but all I ve done is scrawl Lawro is a cunt 246 times Cunt
I feel fucking sick Thank Christ the wife was inhaling solvents in the bathroom If she had caught me I d be on the fucking news right now
I looked on it horror as my shaft exploded like a bottle of disturbed Yop while the doll s innocent smiling face looked coldly back at me
So what did these fucks do Stuck in a picture of a child s doll at 6 mins 59 seconds Cunts I couldn t stop I just I couldn t stop
But the cunts have fucking done me Everyone at West Ham knows I usually blow my bugle at around the seven minute mark during a wank
It was a thing of fucking beauty full of slow motion transitions and soundtracked by Explosions in the Sky My cock was out within seconds
Got my sports science team to put together a video reel full of clips of all those gorgeous European girls captured on camera at Euro 2012
And now we go from Clarence s sweet soulful tones back to Mark Bright sounding like an anxious confused cretin trapped in a lift

But most of all I ll just miss you And the government payments the club recieved for employing you God speed Robert Always in my heart
I ll miss long and cosy afternoons spent teaching you how to read using Birds Eye Alphabites
I ll miss your cute little baseball cap with the plastic propellors on top of it I ll miss your devastating fear or fire electricty
I ll miss the way you dribble in between sentences I ll miss the adorable sight of your soggy mittens lying on the shower room floor
Farewell Rob Green You were like an affectionate remedial son to me I ll miss your confused jam stained face
Yeah Well it s a good job Sir Alex lets me use his account details to watch Sky Go on my Xbox 360 then isn t it Boom
Virgin doesn t even have Sky Atlantic Big Sam I can hear you croak smugly That s like the best channel ever you fucking spunk bag
The leap from Championship manager to a Premier League one really hits home when you can watch Comedy Central in HD I feel fucking awesome
Just upgraded from the Virgin M TV package to the L and added an extra TiVo box for the back room
I ve got a big donation for this Caroline Flack poppet after I ve won this fucking game Right in her lovely little piggy bank
Another afternoon of pretending to care about some kid in Africa with no leg whilst trying to work out who Jonathan Wilkes is B O R I N G
And now I ve got to peel myself away from the shimmering blaze of this glorious sun and go back to my Soccer Aid duties Fuck sake
It won t affect everyone but it will affect enough to make it a real problem I guess what I m saying is just be aware And stay safe
When you add this to the inevitable sweaty climate the heat will bring to this area then I don t need to tell you I could be in trouble
I didn t really wipe my arsehole properly earlier and I can already feel a sloppy stinging repercussion around the greater anal area
The soaring heat of the sun carries many dangers though and I really can t emphasise this enough
The white marks on my upper thighs are adorable Sir Alex said my lower half was like a pint of Guinness when he saw me naked Hilarious
The sun is shining the Premier League is looming my bleached denim shorts are hugging me like a guilty father Life is good for Big Sam
Big Sam pushes apart the thick thighs of panic peels back the labia minora of anxiety and feasts on the very clitoris of triumph
Because I love cunnilingus and it slows me down It really is that simple It s just sexual science
I know what all you TV viewers are thinking right now Hey Big Sam Why don t you grow back your glorious and still stylish moustache
I then sat down gently and lead the boys in a rousing rendition of Crossroads by Bone Thugs N Harmony We re winning this cunt today
He soon forgot all about my lop sided bollocks when I quite literally pissed in his dismal fucking face
Rob Green then ruined the whole aura of the moment by pointing out that my testes are very heavily weighted to the east side of my ballbag
This can be all yours I roared imperiously This can be your destiny You quite simply put can become gods today Join me
Look at me boys I whispered mysteriously Look at the granite like definition Look at the tan Look at my big fucking plonker
Instead I simply stood in front of them Naked Naked and silent but for the gentle swoosh of my cock swinging hypnotically in the breeze
I ve spent hours this morning trying to think of how best to inspire my boys Tactical acumen Poetry Sheer unadulterated rage Sweets No
How can I focus fully on my plans to destroy these seaside tramps when Keegan Michael Key is hitting the comedy ball right out of the park
Incredible episode of Planet s Funniest Animals Christ I m in stitches The dozy dog The weasels That cunt of a cat falling down Ace
Imagine the scenes Hollaway looking like a cunt on the touchline in his tractor while Big Sam pistol whips the linesman with a gatt Word
During his bad boy pomp though Not at the end when he was ravaged by the vicious tentacles of AIDS No one wants to see that at Wembley
I m genuinely tempted to swagger onto the pitch today dressed like Eazy E
Been up since 6am reading American Psycho and listening to Straight Outta Compton I m so fucking pumped I think I might rape myself
She took that a little thick and things did become quite frosty However we soon moved on and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal I had beef
Skin I have a fabulous rapport Weak as I am teased a roguish Big Sam You re not weak love You do look like Carlton Palmer mind
Lunch and a few cheeky cocktails with Skunk Anansie It s such a shame Christ died on a Friday because they really are fucking marvellous
Is 617 a Boston area code Somebody there has been ringing me all day Big Sam ain t got no time to answer though He has a playoff to win
This kid in Child s Play is such a fucking dweeb He dresses just like the fucking doll He deserves to be terrorised by the thing
But there is no escape There s nowhere to go Steve It s just you a deadly fucking doll And it s Big Sam The doll is big fucking Sam
And he s fucking crying He s fucking squealing all over the shop Help me Venky s Help me from escape from this nightmarish nightmare
Then BOOM The doll is all up in his grill tearing at his big bald face and destroying his whole defence with a range of swagger design
He s all like Haha Look at that stupid doll I discovered Phil Jones and he s all cocky and not having a fucking care in the world
Imagine Steve fucking Kean shaking in a court room waiting for Big Sam to strut in only to see a Cabbage Patch Doll walk through the door
I ve been trying it on a Cabbage Patch Doll for the best part of an hour fuck all has happened I m so sick of being lied to by Hollywood
Fuck this Child s Play is a wonderful motion picture but that spell is nothing but fabricated fucking hokum
Auday duay dumbalar Give me the power I beg of you La mwar de sway de pwa de yo Se swa seten de pwa de mor Auday deway dum balar Awake
Ayo lesson here Steve Kean You come at the king you best not miss
All that remained was friendship smiles togetherness and a melodic spiritual harmony you can t buy Not with all the money in Abu Dhabi
As quick as a whip Big Sam launches into La Bamba and a possible situation is pulled back from the brink of disaster
Sir Alex flashed me a look as cold damning as Baroness Warsi s muff I was cocooned in a terror both ethereal and very very real
At one point I let out a mournful guttural yelp It was staggeringly poignant but it basically sounded like I was just shouting Aguero
A few plucks of a steel guitar string with my long sensational fingers can relax that man into a state of almost catotonic splendour
Spent the morning on Skype with Sir Alex soothing his broken heart with some of the most gorgeous Portuguese Fado music you ll ever
No contest Big Sam is the Napoleon of the Championship pushing aside the papal idiocy of the playoffs and crowning himself as Emperor
So the deep fat fried oiks of Blackpool stand in my massive way at Wembley The tactical majesty of Big Sam versus Worzel fucking Gummidge
I might even slip on my vinyl copy of Untrue by Burial for this imminent fuckfest Those creeping moody beats do wonders for my stroke
I guess that s my message to all my loyal fans at Blackburn tonight Keep the faith It won t always be plunged right up your bangle
She stuck it out though Never complained took what was owed and made the best out of it And now she s about to get her rewards

This might sound like one of these internal skirmishes which will resolve itself if given time But it is not And there is very little time left The next CAF president will have a lot of work to do to right his Confederation again And that s leaving its finances aside
Well not really Or not clear But what s clear is that the Governance Committee is not happy with the way CAF s acting pres Omari is telling them what to do and how to do it as this memo makes pretty obvious To sum it up Mind your own business
Why would Omari be worried because the candidates must be cleared 60 days before the vote takes place and this vote is to take place on 12 March Oops That s less than 60 days away now which means Yahya and Motsepe should be disqualified no
Yahya in particular is furious And Fifa is not too happy either as I understand as by general consent he and Motsepe are its favoured candidates So Omari lets the Governance Com that it needs to come to a resolution asap That is unprecedented
In fact I ve never seen anything like it Recap the CAF Governance Committee has vetted two of the five candidates MM Anouma and Senghor Incumbent Ahmad has been disqualified currently under a 5 yr ban by Fifa Remaining two Yahya and Motsepe subject to extra checks
Just saw the Memorandum which Michel K Brizoua Bi pres of CAF s Governance Committee sent to acting CAF pres Constant Omari ExCo and GenSec about the eligibility of candidates to the CAF March election Crazy stuff Have to say I doubt that it ll take place at planned date

When the black dog comes to the door I fear that the world in which this song was written and recorded is gone for good which is probably why I m so shaken at hearing it again tonight
That coda which we sang together when Ayako s voice soars through one of my favourite key changes still sounds arresting to me But what I hear most of all is musicians from all over the world uniting in music It may sound trite but nothing is more precious to me
A familiar feeling Every song you finish is the best in the flush of completion But the record lovely as it was didn t do much Yet I never forgot it and tonight I discovered that someone had posted it on YouTube eight years ago
Timo s arrangement remained faithful to the original harmonies but introduced a modal element which was completely foreign to me at the time I loved it as I loved singing with Ayako and when we d finished I was certain that this was one of the best things I d ever done
I was surrounded by far far more competent musicians than I am all of them graduates from the Sibelius Academy I wondered what Timo would make of my Butterfly Blue which I d demoed with just my voice and a 12 string guitar Then I wondered at what he d done with it
The accordion player in that band was the extraordinary Maria Kalaniemi Listen to her album Kaamos if you can it is magical Winter still lingered The ferry that took me to Suomenlinna was still sailing through ice Just perfect for a first visit to Sibelius s country
A short melancholy thread One of the happiest moments of my musical life was when my friend Ayako Hirakata asked me to write a song for her album Blue My immense luck was that she d got Timo Alakotila to compose the band arrangement We d record it in Helsinki Yes

I was not a Communist But chess wise I was on the side of the Soviets Most of the real artists at the board were Soviets They played imaginative risky glamorous chess Bronstein Spassky Geller my hero then and forever Mikhail Tal Stein Keres Nezhmetdinov

Challenge him By all means Discuss what constitutes cheating in various cultures By all means too A fascinating subject But this kind of sanctimonious and perfunctory apology No not for me
I m glad it isn t Souness s view of Latin sneakiness may be tainted and clumsily expressed but it isn t false in essentia It has a historical and cultural grounding which we should not brush away because it affects our sensitivities Whose btw Not mine And I m a Latin
But the point is we think we live in a world where footballing cultures have somehow blended into a single global perception of what is right and wrong for the game and therefore we can call out the people who step beyond the lines we ve imagined This isn t the case
Neither did it prevent Nobby Stiles from committing one of the worst fouls in WC history when he broke Jacques Simon s leg in a crucial group game England carried on playing and scored That s shithousery on a different level The manly game can be also the most hypocritical
As I was telling earlier on this didn t prevent Jack Charlton from handling the ball on his goal line as sneakily as he could not very well in England s win over Portugal in the 1966 World Cup
So a Scotchman thinks we Latins have a propensity to be cute I don t have a problem with that It s just the way he describes how his own football culture perceives our own Our own perception of the British game is just as prejudiced believe me
I consider myself Latin with some reason a good part of my family comes from Marseille French football is essentially Latin football regardless of where our players parents grandparents came from i e everywhere This is our culture which we claim and are proud of
Sky thought it fit to apologise for the stereotyping of Latin football in its coverage If the apology were needed it should have been left to Souness to present it This kind of public disowning humiliation doesn t sit well with me at all

Voilà pourquoi vainqueur et perdant avaient le sourire après le match avec raison Ils pouvaient être fiers de ce que leurs équipes leur avaient donné Bonne nuit
Ne croyez pas les pubs Tout le monde ne peut pas être the best Vouloir quelque chose ne suffit pas pour l obtenir aussi fort qu on le veuille La seule chose qui devrait compter est qu Arteta tire tout ce qu il peut de son groupe comme Klopp le fait lui aussi
Liverpool a un meilleur effectif quelle surprise Liverpool a van Dijk Alisson Alexander Arnold Fabinho Salah Firmino et Mané A Arsenal seul Aubameyang peut aujourd hui prétendre à être classé dans la même catégorie Et il n y a aucune honte à ça
Malgré tout Arsenal est resté dans le match jusqu au but de Jota Ca se joue à un rien Lacazette loupe un brin sa première touche de balle face à Alisson et complètement sa seconde La leçon n est pas compliquée Arteta est en place depuis moins d un an pas Klopp
Arsenal a peiné à sortir le ballon Mais certainement Pas parce qu Arsenal en est incapable voir les matches précédents mais parce que le pressing appliqué par Liverpool était proche de la perfection dans les placements les accélérations et l intensité
Arsenal a joué ce soir contre ce qui est avec le Bayern la meilleure équipe de la planète et de loin Une équipe qui a produit une performance exceptionnelle ce que Klopp n a pas manqué de relever Les 45 premières minutes des Reds furent ahurissantes parmi leurs meilleures
La sévérité de certains commentaires aperçus ici sur la performance d Arsenal à Anfield ne devrait pas me surprendre l art de regarder un match celui que possèdent ceux et celles qui vont au stade se perd Mais lire de telles âneries d où ce bref fil

Good leaders do not wield power just because they have power Open letter by former High Commissioner to Jamaica and head of T T s women s football on the suspension of her country s FA by Fifa
And the story of Fifa s defeat in the T T High Court
This is a textbook case of what can happen when a bully fears for its power The TTFA board was not without its own blemishes no one disputes that But it is only because they defied Fifa that they were punished
The TTFA s faults Deep down their desire to dig into the alleged misuse of Fifa funds by the previous administration which the new board had evinced in November 2019 Then to question the all englobing power of Fifa and win its case in the High Court
This is what a bully looks like A reminder that the Trinidad Tobago FA won its case against Fifa in their country s High Court then withdrew their case to avoid suspension yet were suspended pour encourager les autres Pure vindictiveness from Fifa

I have to say it is really rare to see a player as comfortable with both feet and not just in terms of the ability to receive and pass but finishing with both feet Southgate on Greenwood and the joy of a two footed player Report from Reykjavik eng
He ll do it differently If he plays wide he s not going to be a winger to hug the touchline We need to give him the freedom to come off the line get between the lines play with the passes that he can He s a beautiful player to watch Southgate on Foden eng mcfc 4 4
We know it s a much tougher ask to get into mcfc team than others It s time to give him his head and we see him being with us eng moving forward And nothing I ve seen this week would suggest in any way that that s not going to be the case So he can play 8 10 7 11 3 4
We felt that while he wasn t a regular for his club to be playing for U 21s was helpful for his development getting regular match time But now we felt at the end of the season and post lockdown he had a really good run of games You could see that physically he d adapted 2 4
We ve known for a long time the ability he has Southgate on Foden I worked with him in an U 15s camp four of five years ago You knew the quality We wanted to be a bit patient We re conscious he s a hugely exciting talent and we didn t want to expose that too early 1 4
Well said Mark Owners take note

And personally I think this is a major problem It s much too easy to win penalties entirely deliberately And so long as you can create some contact you know VAR won t rule it out Which is absurd
So erm I d like to see a good replay of that But it looked to me like Angel ran straight at the centre back pushed him over fell on top of him and won a penalty Entirely responsible for contact totally looking for it albeit defender puts arms out and maybe around
